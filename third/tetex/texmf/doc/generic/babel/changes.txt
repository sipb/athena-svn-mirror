==========================================================================
Fri Apr 30 00:26:00 1999  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* italian.dtx : Claudio Beccari added support for ISO 31/XI 
	regulations

Thu Apr 29 23:36:59 1999  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* greek.fdd (section{The encoding definition file}): Removed the
 	refinition of \& from the encoding file as it doesn't belong
 	there.

	* greek.dtx : Now switch the definition of \& via \extrasgreek
 	(removed from the font encoding file); the greek fonts do not
 	contain an &-sign.

Thu Apr 22 22:30:41 1999  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Multiple languages}): In some situations
	\lefthyphenmin remained equal to -1. This setting is now inside
	the group in which patterns are read. Also added the explicit
	setting of the hyphenmin paramters for language=0 as this didn't
	happen when the first pattern file changes \lefthyphenmin.
	For synonym languages the hyphenmin parameters were not set, this
	is now accomplished by storing the \languagename in \process@line
	Suggested by Vladimir Volovich <vvv@vvv.vsu.ru>

Wed Apr 21 22:48:46 1999  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Cross referencing macros}): It was
	reported by  Richard Walker <Richard.Walker@cs.anu.edu.au>
	(PR 3023) and "Igor A. Kotelnikov" <kotelnikov@nsu.ru> that babel
	brok the cite package This could be solved by *not* redefining
	\bibcite when the cite package is loaded.
	During testing it became clear that running the document the first
	time produced an error; solved by adding an \AtBeginDocument
	action. (babel 3.6v)

Tue Apr 20 21:19:20 1999  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* bbcompat.dtx: Added code to issue a sensible error when the
	.sty files are loaded from LaTeXe; but made sure the document can
	be processed without complaints about \ProvidesLanguage not defined.
	(PR3020, Richard Walker <Richard.Walker@cs.anu.edu.au>)
	Made sure the .sty and .ldf files can be used from plain TeX
	without hyphen.cfg preloaded.

	* babel.dtx (section{The Kernel of Babel}): When plain.def is
	loaded from switch.def we need to define \adddialect first in
	order to access the second part. (babel 3.6u)

Tue Apr 20 00:03:56 1999  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Shorthands}): Removed the braces again
	(PR3022) as the cure poses more problems thatn it solves. Will
	need to find a different solution for the active ^ in esperanto.

Fri Apr 16 01:28:43 1999  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Shorthands}): Added braces around the
	argument when it is apssed on to the next level of shorthand
	evaluation. This in order to keep the argument as in ^{ab} the
	same instead of `losing' the b along the way as part of the
	argument. (babel 3.6t)

Fri Apr 16 00:21:51 1999  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* greek.dtx, babel.dtx : Moved redefinition of \@roman and \@Roman
	back the the greek language support because of the problems it
	causes with the AMS document classes. This problem needs to be
	solved in a different way; \@roman needs to be used in expansion
	only places.
	Reported by Jean-Francois Mertens <jfm@core.ucl.ac.be>(PR 3017)

Tue Apr 13 02:31:28 1999  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Cross referencing macros}): The
	redefinition of \bibcite didn't work for the natbib package; a
	redefinition that works for natbib doesn't work without it.
	Now bibcite defines itself during the processing of the .aux file
	which is done *before* the \AtBeginDocument commands are executed.
	Found by Niilo Siljamo <siljamo@sateenkaari.meteo.helsinki.fi>
	(PR 3011) (babel 3.6s)

Mon Apr 12 22:55:22 1999  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Language options}): Re-instated the
	loading of babel.def right at the begining of babel.sty as it is
	needed to define \ProvidesLanguage. The need for postponing it has
	gone, because \bbl@redefine is no longer used as a warning
	mechanism against missing options (changed in 3.6p dd 9/4/99)
	Found by Werner Struckmann <struck@ips.cs.tu-bs.de> (PR 3006) and
	"Walter Schmidt" <wschmi@ibm.net> (PR 3014) babel 3.6r

Mon Apr 12 00:33:37 1999  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Encodig issues (part 1)}): The parsing of
	\@filelist to determin the latinencoding turend out to fail when a
	file with (default) extension .tex has been loaded. Now use
	\@ifl@aded, assuming all encoding .def files have a ProvidesFile
	entry. Found by "Igor A. Kotelnikov" <kotelnikov@nsu.ru>,
	suggesion by Vladimir Volovich <vvv@vvv.vsu.ru> babel 3.6q

Sat Apr 10 23:49:54 1999  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* polish.dtx : Replaced the word `Proof' with its translation

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Language options}): Adde the options
	ngerman and naustrian to support the new german orthography, as
	supplied by "Walter Schmidt" <wschmi@ibm.net>

Fri Apr  9 23:54:25 1999  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (subsection{marks}): The solution for PR2990 wasn't
	perfect; the arguments to the \mark... commands need to be stored
	in a token register prior to using \edef.
	(subsection{Language options}): Now check for the existence of
	\bbl@main@language instead of redefining \bbl@redefine to detect
	missing options.
	
Fri Apr  9 01:07:41 1999  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* bahasa.dtx : February should be Pebruari according to
	Mohammad DAMT <mdamt@cakraweb.com>

	order to prevent a trailing space from becoming part of a control
	sequence when defining a synonym
	(from a line such as `=english %')
	Found by Thomas Esser <te@informatik.uni-hannover.de>, (PR 2851)

Thu Apr  8 01:00:23 1999  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (subsection{marks}): Removed th use of \head@lang in
	passing the current language into the marks. This didn't work for
	amsart.cls. Found a new solution wich works for the stansdard
	document classes as well as for amsart.
	Reported by Vittorio Coti Zelati <zelati@cds.unina.it> (PR 2990)

Wed Apr  7 00:52:02 1999  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Encodig issues}): Needed to move the
	\AtBeginDocument test for the loading of fontenc right up front of
	babel.sty; also added a test for `manual' selection of T1 without
	loading fontenc (via \renewcommand\encodingdefault{T1}) as
	suggested by Claudio Beccari <Beccari@polito.it>

Mon Apr  5 22:08:50 1999  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx : Had to implement a diferent way to check for fontenc

	(PR 2993, 2995)

	1996 in 1997.

	* finnish.dtx: Forgot to remove the code that is now part of
	\LdfInit; hence babel.def was loaded twice which led to TeX fatal
	errors.
	(found by Niilo Siljamo <Niilo.Siljamo@Helsinki.FI> PR 2386)

Sun Jan 19 22:00:49 1997  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* bbplain.dtx : Got the order of cs's wrong in the definition of
	\@tempcntb (found by Ricardo S. C\'armenes
	<carmenes@biosun.quimica.uniovi.es> PR 2376) 

Fri Jan 17 20:06:30 1997  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	suggested on TEX-NL@nic.surfnet.nl

	* bbplain.dtx : missing \@undefined added to definition of
	\@begindocumenthook; \newcount is an \outer macro, so it can't be
	used directly inside an \if test.

	\bbl@redefine@long to be able to redefine \ifthenelse as a

Wed Jan  8 00:03:37 1997  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* galician.dtx : Removed unwanted space tokens by adding a

	spanish.dtx) 

	* catalan.dtx : Removed unwanted space tokens by adding a
	%-token at the end of the lines with babel@save in the definition
	of \extrascatalan. They turned up in the output. (just like for
	spanish.dtx) 

Tue Jan  7 16:34:20 1997  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* greek.fdd (section{The font definition files}): In some font
	substitutions kdgr hadn't been replaced with cmr.
	(found by J"org Knappen, PR2358)

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Multiple languages}): Introduced
	\foreign@language for the shared code between the otherlanguage*
	environment and the \foreignlanguage command.
	Switch off language shorthands before activating the extras (to
	prevent that the shorthands from one language are still available
	in the other.
	Add \relax after the setting of the hyphenmin parameters to
	prevent the disappearance of a token (when it happens to be a
	digit, such as \number\day).
	(found by Daniel Hempel <daniel@math.uni-hamburg.de> PR2362)

	* spanish.dtx : Removed two unwanted space tokens by adding a
	%-token at the end of the lines with babel@save in the definition

	(found by Daniel Hempel <daniel@math.uni-hamburg.de> PR2362)

	* bbplain.dtx (section{Support for formats based on
	\textsc{plain}\TeX}): add definition of \@begindocumenthook to the
	LaTeX2.09 format; otherwise it won't function without one of the
	languages loaded.
	(found by Olaf Weber <Olaf.Weber@cwi.nl>)

Mon Jan  6 23:20:43 1997  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

Sun Jan  5 20:48:37 1997  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (section{The Package File}): When \LdfInit is
	undefined we need to load babel.def from babel.sty.
        When \file{hyphen.cfg} is not loaded in the format \cs{l@english}
        might not be defined; assume english is language 0 before calling
        \main@language{english}.
	(found by J"org Knappen <tex@mzdmza.zdv.uni-mainz.de> PR2354)

Thu Jan  2 23:18:58 1997  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* bbplain.dtx : The redefinition of \dump tried to detect
	LaTeX2.09; it did that with \document; that cs is also defined by
	AMSTeX, hence an error occured building a Babel-AMSTeX format.
	Now use \@ztryfc to detect LaTeX2.09 (Hope that is obscure
	enough). (Found by Thomas Esser)

Mon Dec 30 15:04:21 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Support for extending macros}): Added a

Sun Dec 29 14:24:42 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* italian.dtx, russian.dtx : Added braces around second argument

	`welsh'.

Thu Nov  7 22:59:23 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Multiple languages}): \selectlanguage now
	checks for the existence of \date<lang> instead of \l@<lang>. The
	latter might be defined, without the language definition file
	being loaded. 

Tue Oct 29 00:42:11 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Multiple languages}): Renamed \init@ldf
	and \finish@ldf to \LdfInit, \ldf@finish and introduce
	\quit@ldf. The second argument of \ldf@init can now be either a
	control sequence or a string to be passed to \csname.
	(subsection{Cross referencing macros}): Added (conditional)
	redefinition of \@@vpageref (varioref internal macro) to prevent

	.ldf-files.

Wed Oct 16 20:34:59 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Multiple languages}): \main@language now
	also sets \languagename and \l@<languagename> for use by other
	packages in the preamble of a document 
	(suggested by Jan Vroonhof <vroonhof@math.ethz.ch>)

Tue Oct  8 00:01:26 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* bbplain.dtx : Make this file be processed twice, once during
	format generation, but only a small portion of the file is loaded
	into the format, the second time the file is processed is when it
	is loaded from babel.def. This way some code that is not needed in
	the format gets removed and the plain format with babel is no
	longer incompatible with german.sty.

Fri Oct  4 12:29:37 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* dutch.dtx: Merged in the definitions for `afrikaans' as supplied
	by Stoffel Lombard <lombc@b31pc87.up.ac.za>

	* catalan.dtx : Added a check for mathmode to the definitino of
	\lgem and \Lgem, as the use of these in mathmode makes no sense
	according to Goncal Badenes. Not having the check led to an error
	message (PR 2261)

Sun Aug 18 00:25:04 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* polish.dtx : The macros \sob, \spb and \skb need to call
	\leavevmode; when they are encountered in vertical mode TeX issues
	an error about \lower not being allowed in vertical mode. (found
	by Wlodzimierz Macewicz <macewicz@ia.pw.edu.pl>)

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Cross referencing macros}): In order to
	prevent problems while reading .fd files in the middle of a
	document we need to add the " and ' characters to \nfss@catcodes
	untill LaTeX does that herself. (found by Tomas	Bautista
	<bautista@cma.ulpgc.es>) 

Thu Aug 15 00:34:21 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* bbplain.dtx : Added default (semi-NFSS2) definition of \ss and
	\i because german.sty in combination with a babel format creates
	an endless lopp on those glyphs. (Found by Bernd Raichle)

	* danish.dtx : According to Peter Busk Laursen the shorthand "'
	needs to typeset the german closing double quote (``). He also
	suggested to add the definitions for "~ and "=

Tue Aug 13 23:58:29 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Shorthands}): Top level expansion of
	\normal@char<char> where the shorthand character is already active
	should be the expansion of the active character, not the active
	character itself as this causes an endless loop (found by Tomas
	Bautista <bautista@cma.ulpgc.es>)

Sun Aug 11 23:19:42 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Cross referencing macros}): Redefinition

	* germanb.dtx : added \allowhyphens in the definitions of "a, "o,
	"u, "A, "O, "U, because the underlying macro \lower@umlaut can not
	cntain a \allowhyphens. The reason is that for *dutch* we need to
	use discretionaries for these same characters in order to make the
	trema disappear at a word break. A \allowhyphens inside one of the
	arguments of \discretiionary leads to a TeX error.

Wed May 29 23:55:10 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Multiple languages}): Added an environment
	otherlanguage* wich does not switch the captions and date strings,

 	Sime Ungar <ungar@math.hr> and David Carlisle)

Wed Mar  6 00:00:05 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	of the ~-character so it remains unchanged by
	\initiate@active@char

Wed Jan 24 23:02:06 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Macros common to a number of languages}):
	Moved \german@dq@disc, \usorbian@dq@disc and \swedish@dq@disc to
	babel.def, changing the name to \bbl@disc

Sun Jan 21 23:28:57 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Cross referencing macros}): Revert the
	previous change; \@setref gets expanded too late which results in
	TeX errors because the active character isn't redefined when TeX
	tries to use it in constructing a csname.

Fri Jan 19 23:42:50 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Cross referencing macros}): Redefine
	\@setref instead of \ref and \pageref for LaTeX2e. This (partly)
	solves PR0947 which complains about pageref being used in the
	argument of \ifthenelse. This now works as long as the label
	doesn't contain active characters.

Thu Jan 18 23:12:00 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

Mon Jan 15 23:44:52 1996  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	already active: define the top level expansion inside the \if
	branch of the category code test; define all lower level expansion
	macros needed for the shorthand stuff after of the \else branch
	(subsection{Cross referencing macros}): Complete rewrite of
	\@testdef using meaning to prevent endless complaints from LaTeX
	about possibly changed labels.

Fri Dec  1 13:02:52 1995  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Shorthands}): Reset the category code of a

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Multiple languages}): Changed the
	definition of \selectlanguage and \selectlanguage_; the former no
	longer processes its argument, that task is now performed by
	\selectlanguage_

Wed Nov 15 00:24:48 1995  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Cross referencing macros}): Added the
	commands \bbl@redefine and \bbl@redefinerobust and used them to
	redefine \newlabel, \@testdef, \ref, \pageref, \label, \@citex,

	improve hyphenation
	(As suggested by Claudio Beccari <BECCARI@polito.it>)

	improve hyphenation 
	(As suggested by Claudio Beccari <BECCARI@polito.it>)

Wed Nov  8 00:50:45 1995  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* bbplain.dtx: Added the code that `snatched' \dump as it is still
	needed for LaTeX 2.09

	that `snatched' \dump as it is no longer needed for LaTeX.

Mon Nov  6 00:44:49 1995  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Cross referencing macros}): No longer use
	\bblref_ as a cs; instead use \ref_ and check if it isn't defined

Thu Aug 31 00:19:12 1995  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* germanb.dtx : Added \allowhyphens to the accent producing
	shorthands. Not having it prevented hyphenation for accented words
	in OT1 encoding. Having it means that TeX possibly misses a
	possible breakpoint. Putting \allowhyphens into the definition of
	\lower@umlaut (which would make it not appear at all in T1
	encoding) is a no-no because it leads to improper discretionary
	errors for dutch (were trema's have to disappear when the word is
	hyphenated next to the trema). (PRs 1118, 1147, 1714, 1846)

Wed Aug 30 00:11:50 1995  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* spanish.dtx, catalan.dtx, galician.dtx: Combining
	\initiate@active@char and \bbl@activate in one \@ifpackagewith
	statement leads to an error message about an \inaccessible control
	sequence from \select@language. For now split these statements.

Mon Aug  7 00:27:13 1995  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Shorthands for quotation marks}):

	* irish.dtx : load irish.cfg instead of danish.cfg

	by Enn Saar)

Sat Jul  8 00:03:41 1995  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

Wed Feb 15 10:54:33 1995  Johannes Braams  <JLBraams@cistron.nl>

	* germanb.dtx: Removed a lot of code that is now present in
	babel.def (things like \flqq, the double quote mechanism, etc.);
	Use \Declaredq now.
	Brought up to date with german.sty version 2.5b

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Multiple languages}): Added the command
	\@activated to be used for logging when characters are made
	active. Introduced the \if@safe@actives switch which should be
	checked on the highest level expansion of an active
	character. This first expansion is defined by \UseActive.
	(subsection{Cross referencing macros}): Removed the meaning trick
	and introduced the use of the \if@safe@actives switch. Not all
	cross referencing macros need to be aware of this switch.

	and \ij and \IJ to glyphs.dtx

	match the dc-versions more closely.

	* babel.dtx (subsection{Support for active double quote}): Added
	this section with generic macros to support making the double
	quote character active. A language definition file now only needs
	call \Activatedq and use \Declaredq{}{}{} to define its actions.

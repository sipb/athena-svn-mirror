1) the following command shows useless (because of \lefthyphenmin=2)
or incorrect patterns which set hyphenation after the first letter:

grep '^\..[0-9]' ruhyph*.tex

ruhyphas.tex:
.8888
.5棕4
.4宰乓
.4宰乓帜

ruhyphzn.tex:
.23蚁
.443蚁
.443蚁
.443蚁
.443蚁
.443蚁

2) the following command shows useless (because of \righthyphenmin=2)
or incorrect patterns which set hyphenation before the last letter:

grep '[0-9].\.$' ruhyph*.tex

ruhyphas.tex:
.仗5.
.淖56.

ruhyphzn.tex:
12遗3.

3) the patterns for the whole words shown by the command

grep '^\..*\.$' ruhyph*.tex

are also questionable (probably it is better to store them in
\hyphenation list). Such patterns occur in ruhyphas.tex and
ruhyphzn.tex.

4) to ensure that there will be absolutely no -xx breaks for English
words when the combined Russian-English hyphenation is used, a changed
English patterns should be used, with removed `strange' patterns
matching the regexp "[0-9][a-z][a-z]\." (see the file enrhm2.tex).

5) [not a bug] should the main hyphenation files be sorted using
`sorthyph' script?

6) Known cases of bad hyphenation (to be fixed by authors of
corresponding patterns). All found hyphenation positions are shown.
Bad positions are marked with `='. Please send additional examples of
bad hyphenation for various patterns in this collection to email
addresses given at the end of README. See also some other examples
in the file release.notes of Alexander Lebedev's patterns at
ftp://mch5.chem.msu.su/pub/russian/hyphen/ruhyphal.tar.gz

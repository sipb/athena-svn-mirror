                              CUSTOM-BIB Package

**** INFO ******
Version 3.x now called  merlin.mbs   replacing genbst.mbs and babel.mbs
Current version is 3.89
*****************
Major changes over 3.88: (see full list below) 
  Compatible with natbib 7.0: when key field substitutes for missing
    author/editor, then the year is left blank (natbib 7.0 then only prints
    the key without year punctuation) 
    Also (optional) if year is empty, it is left blank; previously year was
      always set to ????.

*****************

This is the custom-bib package for generating customized BibTeX bibliography
styles from a generic file by means of Frank Mittelbach's docstrip program.

Many authors are frustrated at the wide range of bibliographic styles demanded
by journals and publishers, and at the limited number available with standard
LaTeX and BibTeX. This is not the fault of the latter, but rather of the lack
of any bibliographic standards in the English language. Often the differences
are so trivial (comma or colon, date in brackets or parentheses). The normal
user does not want to tackle the task of making up his own .bst file (no
normal human would!) 

For this reason, I set out to produce a generic .bst file that could have
features and options selected by means of Mittelbach's docstrip program. 
I found over 50 different *.bst files and compared their outputs just for
article: they were all different. They served as part of my input as to which
features were needed. I knew of a few extra that were not covered by these 50.

I also discovered XBTXBST.DOC, a minor modification of Patashnik's BTXBST.DOC,
as well as a file PHYSICS.BST, all of which are meant to do precisely what I
had set up to accomplish. However, they make use of the C Preprocessor
language. It is really a simple matter to convert the preprocessor commands
into docstrip equivalents. 

Nevertheless, none of these really met all of my needs, so I continued to
develop GENBST.mbs (GENeric-BibST.MasterBibSt). It soon became obvious that the
sheer number of options necessary made any kind of customizing a difficult
chore. Hence, the next step: the program MAKEBST takes menu information from
the selected .mbs file and presents the user with descriptive choices as
menus. From the answers, it writes a docstrip batch job (extension .dbj) which
when TeX'ed, creates the desired .bst file out of the .mbs one. The .dbj file
may even be hand edited if one wants to alter only one or two options.

Since I first released this system in November 1993, I have received many
suggestions and requests for additions. I have tried to incorporate as many as
possible, but often the task is too complicated and I have to leave them out.

The second version of GENBST.mbs allowed other languages to be used. However,
since the method had considerable overhead per language, I was unsatified with
it. A parallel version called BABEL.mbs (which was really GENBST.mbs version
2) has been available for some time, supporting English, French, German, and
Esperanto, as well as a generic language called Babel.

I have now modified MAKEBST to allow more than one .mbs file to be used as 
input for any given .bst output. This means that the language support can be
contained in separate files, one per language, and does not need to burden the
main file. The new issue of this main file, version 3, is now called
MERLIN.mbs, to emphasize its magical powers.

To use the package: (I assume you have docstrip.tex and doc.sty; if you do not
  have the former, then you cannot use the package anyway; they are now part
  of the standard LaTeX (2e) distribution from 1994 June 1.)

0. (optional, for hackers) LaTeX makebst.dtx to get the documentation;
     This also extracts makebst.ins from makebst.dtx, if it does not already
     exist.
1. Run TeX (or LaTeX) on makebst.ins (--> makebst.tex)
2. Run TeX (or LaTeX) on makebst.tex to start customizing
     your own .bst file. You may select the master file as either merlin
     (default), or one of the older genbst and babel, if you have them.
3. Answer the questions that then arise; for merlin, you will also be asked
     which language support file you want (default is merlin itself, meaning
     English or the pseudo-language Babel). You will also be asked if you want
     to add a file defining short-hand designations for various journals; such
     files are included (physjour.mbs, photjour.mbs) for Physics and Optics 
     journals, but you could create your own.
4. The menus that appear may not be informative enough for you. More
     information can be obtained by reading the documentation (on the options)
     contained in the .mbs files themselves. This documentation can be printed
     out by running LaTeX on the .mbs files.
5. The makebst program only produces a docstrip batch job to generate the .bst
     file. The last question it asks is whether that job should be run right
     away. You can always run it again yourself by running TeX or LaTeX on
     this .dbj file. (The .dbj file can also be manually edited if you want to
     play around with the various options it includes.)

NOTE ON AUTHOR-YEAR CITATIONS:-
Author-year style citations are not supported by standard LaTeX and BibTeX.
However, there exist a large number of bib styles for this, all of which need
some interface package to run properly. I have identified 5 different 
interfaces, plus a 6th one that I use myself (see the NATBIB package in a
parallel directory). I have made up merlin.mbs to be able to produce .bst
files for all 6. If one selects author-year style, then one is asked which
interface package is to be used. (Incidentally my natbib.sty is capable of
interpreting all 6!)

LIST OF ALL OPTIONS IN THE DBJ FILE 
The makebst program writes to the .dbj file all the docstrip options that were 
offered in the interactive session with the unselected ones commented out. 
This makes editing afterwards much easier. Often one wants to experiment with 
some of these options, but only wants to run the makebst program once. 

This feature (suggested by Frank Mittelbach) is available when the 
makebst.tex file is extracted from makebst.dtx with the `optlist' option;
without it, only the selected options are listed in the .dbj file.
Edit the makebst.ins file accordingly; by default, this feature is included.

ALLOW MULTIPLE INPUT .MBS FILES 
The .dbj file is now so constructed that \generateFile can read in more than
one input .mbs file for a single output .bst file. The main .mbs file must
have its menu coding arranged to take advantage of this. Older .mbs files
(like genbst.mbs and babel.mbs) will still work just as well with this version
of makebst. Similarly, merlin.mbs can be used with older versions of makebst,
but without any additional input files.

NEW FEATURES OF MERLIN.MBS since genbst.mbs 1.7 and babel 2.5
Names formatting:  can also have reversed full names, as Smith, John George
                   (previously reversed names could only be initials)
   John George Smith
   Smith, John George  (v3.1)
   J. G. Smith
   Smith, J. G.
   (AGU style: first name reversed, rest normal, all with initials)
   (AGU style but with full names, not initials)  (v3.82)
   Smith, J G
   Smith, JG   (v3.1)
   Smith J G   (v3.2)
   
Editors' names (in collections) for surname-first styles, may now be formatted
   exactly as the authors'. (Previously these would never be reversed.)

   Also possible to have 
                In: B. G. Jones, editor, Booktitle  [default]
                In: B. G. Jones, (editor), Booktitle
                In: B. G. Jones, (editor) Booktitle
                In: Booktitle, edited by B. G. Jones
                In: Booktitle (edited by B. G. Jones)
                In: Booktitle, (edited by B. G. Jones)
                In: Booktitle, editor B. G. Jones
                In: Booktitle, (editor) B. G. Jones
                In: Booktitle (editorB. G. Jones)
                In: Booktitle, (editorB. G. Jones)
                In: Booktitle, B. G. Jones, editor
                In: Booktitle (B. G. Jones, editor)

ISBN numbers can optionally be included, if present in database

Volume, number has more possibilities: for volume=34, number=2:
  34(2)   34 (2)   34, 2   34, no. 2    34, #2    34   34(1997)
(Last example: the year in parentheses in place of the number)

The following page number can be separated by colon, colon space, 
   semi-colon and space, comma and space, or space only

Or even   vol. 34 (1994) 2, pp. 234-254  (v3.81)
   
Date: year coming just after authors may have colon and space following
      date may appear as `1994 Jul', with or without a dot (v3.2)
      date may be part of journal specification, something that is common
        in medical journals (v3.2)

Journal names: the periods in abbreviations may be removed, so Phys. Rev.
   becomes Phys Rev  (no change to database necessary)
   
Author names in citations (as opposed to list of references)
  may be italic, small caps, or bold (last two new)

The mininum number of authors' names before et al. has been raised from 
  6 to 99 (v3.87)

The page numbers in edited works can have `pages' or `pp' suppressed (v3.2)

It is possible to have the names sorted by ignoring the `von' part, so that
  della Robbia comes after Rabin (v3.2)

Publisher's address may come before name, as New York: New Press
  (required by some psychology journals) (v3.3)

Publisher's address may come before the chapter/page information (v3.81)

Number/series can come just before publisher/organization (v3.88)

HTML output added (v3.88)

Refinements added to version 3.3: 
  - the extra labels added to years (as 1995a) are grouped in braces
    to avoid some problems with natbib when this extra label is more than
    one letter
    
  - when full author lists may be optional (for harvard and natbib formats)
    they are no longer included if they are identical to the short 
    author list

Refinements added to version 3.4:
  - journals can have date between volume and pages, as
       J. Geophys. Res. {\bf 34} (1994) 333-338
  - author block can be terminated with colon
  - if cited authors are in bold, italic, or small caps, then the word
      `and' can be in the regular text font, not in the author font.

Refinements added to version 3.5:
  - Technical Reports can have titles treated like books (default=article)
  - can sort by year then authors
  - can include more than one file with prestored journal names 
  - bug fixed for limited number of authors: sort only on those present
  - the `named' format for \bibitem now included.

Refinements added to version 3.6:
  - blocks can be separated by colons as well as commas or periods
  - name of journal can be in normal font, not only italic
  - pages in books may be in parentheses
  - can have `number' as part of page specification:  34, (2)234-(2)254
  - date may be bold
  - if authors in list have special font, then `and' and/or `et al.' 
    may be normal font

Refinements added to version 3.7:
  - an option to allow authors to be separated by semi-colons instead of
    by commas
  - fix bug in the option that removes periods from journal names when
    italicized

Refinements added to version 3.8:
  - fix a bug with titles in quotes
  - an option allows ALPHA style citations, of the form  ABD90. This
    is essentially a numerical system with some text replacing the number.
  - publishers and address can appear in parentheses 
  - punctuation between `blocks' can be suppressed, space only
  - ordering reference list by year is possible for author-year as well as
     numerical modes
  - can put date between volume and number
  - can add `pages' or `pp' to articles
  - cited names in a special font can have the `and' in regular font:
    previously this meant \rm, but now, with NFSS, only the one attribute is
    reset; thus  \textbf{\cite{james93}} yields
       \textbf{\textsc{James {\upshape and} Johns}, [1993]}
    so that `and' will be bold non-sc. (Actually, bold small caps does not
    exist in the CM fonts, so a substitution will be made.)

Refinements added to version 3.81:
  - when used with natbib 6.3, the extra letters added to the dates in 
    author-year citations (Jones et al, 1994a) are suppressed in the reference
    list when numerical citations are used instead. These letters are
    superfluous in this case and so should not be present.
  - For incollections, the word `in' can be left off.
  - Publisher can be placed before chapter/page information
  - dates can be followed by periods even when block punctuation is comma

  - The .mbs files with prestored journal names have been rationalized, to
    remove duplications (or shorthands) and to organize the journal types
    better. Some journals were present several times under different
    shorthands (Phys. Rev. is both pr and physrev); these multiple shorthands
    have been retained for consistency. Duplications of journal AND shorthand
    have been removed. One shorthand clash: jas was both Journal of Applied
    Spectroscopy and Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences; the former has been
    altered to jasp.
  - A file shorthnd.ins is included to assist listing the journal shorthands

  - Option yr-com to allow comma before the date.
  - Option pub-date to put publisher and date in parentheses (Nature style)
  - Some internal improvements

Refinements added to version 3.82:
  - Page numbers can come at end before notes
  - Fix up bug with quoted titles when title missing
  - Fix up bug that left off extra date labels for plain dates with no brackets
       or special punctuation
  - Fix up bug that put punctuation before publishers in paretheses
  - Add option to allow full names, with only first author reversed

Refinements added to version 3.83:
  - Edited works can be either     Names (eds.), Booktitle
                          or       Names, (eds.) Booktitle
    Previously only the first version was possible. (There are several other
      possibilities too.)
  - If commas selected as punctuation between blocks, one can still have a
      period coming before any file note.
  - With repeated authors/editors for adjacent references, the repeated names
      can be replaced by a long dash.
  - \BIBand made robust, otherwise it does not really work.

Refinements added to version 3.84:
  - large page numbers can be separated by comma, space, period, 
     as  10,345. No provision for 7 digit numbers
  - emphasis can also be underlining; bad policy, since underlining belongs
     to the days of the typewriter, and in LaTeX, \underline command cannot
     be broken across lines. Loading the ulem package by Donald Arseneau 
     solves this problem.
  - titles can be in <<guillemots>> (best with T1 encoding, but poor man's
     OT1 also provided; must have LaTeX2e)
  - titles of proceedings and collections can be in quotes if article
     titles in quotes
  - can add year to journal volume in parentheses as vol(year) and still
     format year for books differently.
  - full natbib form of \bibitem resistent against square brackets in names
     or date.

Refinements added to version 3.85:
  - add option to allow junior part of name of appear in citations
  - options for specifying fonts for names: may apply only to the surnames
      if wished, and not to the entire name. User-defined font commands
      \bibnamefont,  \bibfnamefont, and \citenamefont  may be used too,
      where the names are used as a single argument.

Refinements added to version 3.86:
  - suppress ISBN number for certain crossrefs
  - fix bug with limited number of authors when mininum is 6
  - add option for comma between year and pages
  - restrict \natexlab to natbib styles

Refinements added to version 3.87:
  - Limited number of authors can be as many as 99 (previously 6)
  - Add language field, to switch hyphenation patterns for titles
  - Add url field for all entries
  - Add annote field 
  - Months may be suppressed for numerical mode
  - et~al. is no longer hardwired; dutch.mbs allows variations on et~al.

Refinements added to version 3.88:
  - Copyright notices conform to LaTeX Project Public Licence
  - HTML coding can replace the LaTeX pre- and postamble and font commands; 
    intended for Web listings of complete databases; LaTeX special symbol 
    remain; works only if one selects numerical, not author-year citations.
  - complex coding to convert edition numbers to (multilingual) text and vice 
    versa can be removed, saving considerable memory requirements and 
    possibly preventing memory overflow
  - by default, number and series for inproceedings and incollection can only 
    be used as "Complete Works" (series only) or "Number 3 in Complete Works"
    (number and series). With number only, a warning is issued. New option 
    allows number to be a document code number, like REP-01/1998-ab; without 
    series, this number is printed bare, without the word "Number", but if 
    both number and series are present, the default text "Number .. in .." is 
    reinstated.
  - another option allows the number/series to be prepended to the publisher 
    and/or organization name.
  - more options to format editors in inproceedings and incollection  
  - option to allow the total number of pages in books to be listed; for 
    this, the pages field must be given for the entry, a field that is 
    normally ignored for books.
  - book titles may be set in upright typeface (default is italic)
  - a slash may be used in place of comma or semi-colon between authors
  - journal names may be preceded by `in' as for incollections

Refinements added to version 3.89:
  -  for use with natbib 7.0: 
       when author/editor empty, the key field is used in place of author,
         but what is new is the option that the year is then left blank
         in the \bibitem entry. This allows natbib (7.0) to print only the 
         key without any year punctuation.
       also optional, if the year itself is missing, it is left blank instead 
         of being set to ????.
  -  fix a bug that caused the citation font to be missing at times

The package contains the following files:
  merlin.mbs   --  A master BibTeX style file for producing customized
                   styles (numerical or author-year) with docstrip. It is
                   self-documenting: simply latex it to produce its
                   description. 
                   
  english.mbs  --  A sample language support file for English, to act as a
                   model for hacking others.
                   
  catalan.mbs  --  A language support file for Catalan
  dutch.mbs    --  A language support file for Dutch
  esperant.mbs --  A language support file for Esperanto 
  finnish.mbs  --  A language support file for Finnish 
  french.mbs   --  A language support file for French 
  german.mbs   --  A language support file for German 
  italian.mbs  --  A language support file for Italian 
  norsk.mbs    --  A language support file for Norwegian
  portuges.mbs --  A language support file for Portuguese
  spanish.mbs  --  A language support file for Spanish 
(Further contributions and corrections are welcome)

  physjour.mbs --  A support file to add the names of common Physics journals
                   in shorthand form, for example `pr' for Physical Review, or
                   Phys. Rev., depending on whether abbreviations are chosen.

  photjour.mbs --  A contributed file containing names of optics journals

  geojour.mbs  --  A contributed file containing names of geophysics journals
  suppjour.mbs --  A contributed file containing further journal names

(Contributions for other fields are welcome)  

  shorthnd.ins --  (La)TeX this file to obtain shorthnd.tex, which when 
                   LaTeX'ed lists all the shorthands and journal names

The .mbs files can only be used effectively with the makebst `program', which
is included in documented source form.

  makebst.dtx  --  the documented source file; LaTeXing this file produces
                   the manual and optionally a documentation of the coding.
                   Requires ltxdoc class from the LaTeX2e distribution.

                   This is version 3.1; the documentation requires 
                   LaTeX2e (1994/06/01). The program itself only 
                   requires Plain TeX. This version tests for Dec 96 
                   version of docstrip and produces .dbj files with new 
                   syntax if it is present. 

  makebst.ins  --  a docstrip batch job to extract from makebst.dtx the 
                   program file makebst.tex. (This file is actually included
                   within makebst.dtx; it is extracted when the .dtx file is
                   processed under LaTeX2e.)

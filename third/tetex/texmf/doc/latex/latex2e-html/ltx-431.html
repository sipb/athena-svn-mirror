LaTeX normally leaves a little extra space after sentences.  However, it
uses a rather simple rule for determining whether a period ends a 
sentence: it assumes that periods end sentences <em>unless</em> they
follow an upper case letter. To let LaTeX know that a period does
<em>not</em> end a sentence after, for example, an abbreviation, use:
<p>
 <tt>\&lt;space&gt;</tt>
<p>
For example,
<pre>
  <tt>Jones, et al.\ (1993) ...</tt>
</pre>
Such a space may also be needed after a text-producing command,
such as one defined with <a href="ltx-18.html"><tt>\newcommand</tt></a>.
As an example, consider
<pre>
  <tt>\newcommand{\water}{H$_2$O}
  \water, \water\ everywhere, but not a drop ...</tt>
</pre>
The first <tt>\water</tt> command is terminated by the comma;
note that LaTeX does not leave a space between the first <tt>\water</tt>
and the comma -- as desired -- and the trailing space is treated as an 
interword space.  However, the second <tt>\water</tt> command
is terminated by the space, but LaTeX  would not leave an extra space after
this, running "H<sub>2</sub>Owater" into one word, except for  the
trailing <tt>\ </tt>. 
<p>
An alternate way to indicate the end of a command so that a trailing
space is interpreted as an interword space is to use braces:
<pre>
  <tt>\water, \water{} everywhere, ...</tt>
</pre>

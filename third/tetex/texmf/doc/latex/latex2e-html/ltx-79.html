 The <tt>verbatim</tt> environment is a paragraph-making  environment  
 that gets
 LaTeX  to print  exactly  what you type in.   It turns  LaTeX  into  a
 typewriter  with carriage  returns  and blanks having  the same effect
 that they would on a typewriter.  The output looks exactly as it
 looks in the input file.
<p>
 The difference between <tt>verbatim</tt> and <tt>verbatim*</tt>
 is that the latter prints spaces as "visual" spaces, i.e.,
 a short, squat "u".
<p>
 The only text which cannot be placed in the <tt>verbatim</tt>
 environment is the 14-character sequence "\end{verbatim}".
<p>
 The <tt>verbatim</tt> environment may <strong>not</strong> be used
 in the argument of another command.  However, it <strong>can</strong> be
 placed inside a <a href="ltx-267.html">minipage environment</a> which 
 allows you to manipulate it's placement.

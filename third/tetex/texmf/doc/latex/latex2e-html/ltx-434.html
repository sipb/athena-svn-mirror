You can insert comments into the LaTeX input (*.tex) file. Anything following
a percent sign (<tt>%</tt>) until the end of the line is ignored by the 
LaTeX processor. 
<p>
In fact, the <tt>%</tt> ends a line without generating a space;
an end-of-line in LaTeX input is normally equivalent to a space.
Thus, for example, it allows one to split a word
over lines without inserting a break.  For example
<pre>
  <tt> this is an extr%
       ordinarily long word</tt>
</pre>
would produce "this is an extraordinarily long word" with no breaks.
However, a <strong>command</strong> cannot be split over lines this way.

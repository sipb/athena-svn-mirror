===========================================================================
  News in release 1.0:
===========================================================================
- updated programs: web2c 7.3.1, xdvik 22.05-k, dvips(k) 5.86, dviljk 2.6p2,
  texinfo 3.12. xdvik and dvipsk are now hypertex aware. The new
  kpathsea library allows to have a ls-R file in each texmf tree. TeX
  and friends now support true 8bit reading/writing by means of the
  TCX extension.  Some arrays which had a fixed size in TeX+friends now
  increase dynamically, others can read their size from a config file
  (which means that they can be enlarged without recompilation).
- added programs: pdftex 0.13d, e-TeX 2.1, Omega 1.8
- ConTeXt added
- Postscript type 1 font versions: Computer Modern, AMS fonts, 35 base
  laserwriter fonts, Polish and Cyrillic variants of CM and others
- much improved index file for the documentation tree (newhelpindex.html)
- metrics for Y&Y's commercial mathtime and lucida bright fonts are
  included, which greatly simplifies using these fonts

This release is now called 1.0, because all extensions of previous
versions (e.g. make TeX use ls-R etc.) have become official part of the
web2c and kpathsea distribution and no longer require special patches.
Additionally, temporary hacks which required GNU utils (GNU make, gcc,
flex) could be removed and replaced by portable solutions.

This release has many advantages for perparing documents for the web,
due to improved/added programs. pdf files with hyperlinks and thumbnails
can be created either by using dvips+distiller or more directly by
using pdftex. Postscript with resolution-independant fonts can be
generated due to the included postscript type 1 fonts.

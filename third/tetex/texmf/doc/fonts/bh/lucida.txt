Available encodings are T1, TS1 (text companion) and LY1.


Usage notes
===========

* The obsolete OT1 font encoding, while still being the
default with LaTeX, is _not_ supported.  Thus, you should
switch to T1/TS1 or LY1 before using the Lucida Bright
fonts, for instance:

  \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
  \usepackage{textcomp}
  \usepackage{lucidabr}
  ...

* Many, but not all of the Lucida fonts provide an Euro
symbol \texteuro in the LY1 and TS1 encoding.  Families or
shapes that are lacking the Euro are marked in the above
table with an asterisk.  

* The symbols of the TS1 (text companion) font encoding are
only partially available:  The Lucida fonts include only
those symbols that belong to the Adobe Standard Encoding
plus the Euro symbol.

* All demibold fonts are assigned to series `b'.  The two
sans serif bold fonts are assigned to `ub' (ultra bold).
This means that with the exception of the Sans bold fonts
_all_ fonts in the Lucida Bright font set are available
through normal `user level' commands such as \bfseries,
\sffamily etc.  To access the bold Sans Serif one may go
\fontseries{ub}\sffamily.

* The blackletter font is made available in math mode as
\mathfrak (with the lucidabr or lucbmath package).  If you
want to use this as a text font, you should define a command
to execute \fontfamily{hlcf}\selectfont.  Unfortunately, the
available encodings do _not_ provide the "long s", but
LucidaBlackletter was not made to mimick historical
typesetting, anyway.

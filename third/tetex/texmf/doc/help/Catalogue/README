Load <a href="catalogue.html">catalogue.html</a> into your Web browser
for a hypertext catalogue of this CTAN archive.

These documents catalogue TeX and related packages and systems
(mostly) available on CTAN. The source database in <a
href="catalogue.xml">catalogue.xml</a> is regularly updated and
maintained by <a href="http://www.cmis.csiro.au/Graham.Williams">Graham
Williams</a>.

The latest version is directly available from my home ftp archive <a
href="ftp://ftp.cbr.dit.csiro.au/staff/gjw/Catalogue/catalogue.xml">
ftp://ftp.cbr.dit.csiro.au/staff/gjw/Catalogue/catalogue.xml</a>.

The source database is atomatically converted to various HTML editions
with short descriptions and hypertext links that take you to the
actual files/directories on the local CTAN host.  Links to alternative
CTAN hosts are also provided as are links to any available online
documentation.

A generic version of the Web document which searches for a nearby
CTAN node can be found at: <a

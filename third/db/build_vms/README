README for Berkeley DB on OpenVMS 3-Nov-1998

The DB libraries and utilities have been built and casually tested on
OpenVMS 7.1 with the DECC compiler.  The DB testing suite has not been
ported to OpenVMS, so extensive testing was not done.

DB will not build on OpenVMS 6.x due to the lack of some C RTL functions
such as mmap().

The included makefile should work with little or no modifications with
the make program from the DECUS library.  It has only been used to build
the object library and the utilities (no doc or test routines):

LIBDB.OLB
DB_ARCHIVE.EXE
DB_CHECKPOINT.EXE
DB_DEADLOCK.EXE
DB_DUMP.EXE
DB_LOAD.EXE
DB_RECOVER.EXE
DB_STAT.EXE

READ.ME file for AMS-LaTeX 1.2, 1996/12/19

[This file resides in the `amslatex' parent directory of the AMS-LaTeX
distribution; for the present, however, a copy is also placed in the
`math' subdirectory to ensure that the READ.ME file is found on CTAN
(pending resolution of some mirroring complications). 1995/10/23 mjd]

AMS-LaTeX is a collection of various extensions for LaTeX to provide
support for sophisticated mathematical typesetting. It has been
developed by the American Mathematical Society and released for general
use as a service to the mathematical community. It is in many cases
distributed at no extra charge with LaTeX, as well as being available
through standard sources of TeX-related software such as the
Comprehensive TeX Archive Network (CTAN) (addresses ftp.cdrom.com (USA),
ftp.dante.de (Germany), ftp.tex.ac.uk (UK), and others). Technical
support for AMS-LaTeX is provided by the AMS:

UPGRADING FROM VERSIONS 1.0, 1.1, OR 1.2beta

If you are upgrading from an earlier version of AMS-LaTeX, please print
out and read diff12.tex, which describes the changes made for version 1.2.
In particular, all LaTeX support that is concerned only with fonts in the
AMSFonts collection has been moved to the AMSFonts distribution, and the
amstex package has been superseded by a package called amsmath (although
a frozen copy of amstex.sty is provided for use with existing documents).

Instructions for using AMS documentclasses are no longer included in the
`AMS-LaTeX User's Guide', amsldoc.tex. They are now found instead in
instr-l.tex in the `classes' subdirectory (`Instructions for Preparation
of Papers and Monographs: AMS-LaTeX'). This is a copy of the file
instr-l.tex that is found in the author-info area of e-math.ams.org,
which contains information pertaining specifically to the submission of
AMS-LaTeX documents to AMS publications.

INSTALLATION

To use AMS-LaTeX version 1.2 you must first have a recent version of LaTeX
(December 1994 or later, `LaTeX2e'; although a later version is not required,
it is highly recommended). If you're not sure about the version, look at
the startup message that is printed on screen and in the TeX log when you
run LaTeX. It should mention the LaTeX version number and date somewhere in
the first ten lines. If your version of LaTeX is older than December 1994,
we suggest getting the latest version from the Comprehensive TeX Archive
Network (CTAN), directory tex-archive/macros/latex, ftp addresses as given
above. If ftp file transfer is not an option for you, contact the source
from which you originally obtained LaTeX. If you are unable for some reason
to upgrade from version 2.09 of LaTeX, you could try using version 1.1 of
AMS-LaTeX, which is available in a separate area (on e-math.ams.org:
/pub/tex/amsltx11).

If you intend to use an old version of AMSFonts (2.1 or earlier) with
AMS-LaTeX 1.2, you will need some additional files that are part of the
AMSFonts distribution.  These are located in the area /pub/tex/amsfonts/latex
of the AMS ftp archive (e-math.ams.org), and should be installed in the LaTeX
input files area (see below).

More specific information on preparing a LaTeX document for submission to the
AMS is found in the `author-info' area of the AMS archive.

PUTTING FILES IN A SUITABLE PLACE ON YOUR SYSTEM:

There are two `areas' (directories or folders) on your system that are
involved in installing AMS-LaTeX: an AMS-LaTeX source files area, and a
LaTeX input files area. All files in the `inputs' subdirectory of the
AMS-LaTeX distribution should be placed in the LaTeX input directory or
folder on your system, or if your system is built according to the TDS
(TeX Directory Structure) standard, in an amslatex subdirectory to this
directory. Consult your TeX documentation if you don't know where this is.
(You could also try looking for the file article.cls; the place where you
find it is almost surely your LaTeX input files area.) Some representative
examples:

PC/DOS/emTeX:

  LaTeX input files area --- c:\emtex\latex\inputs
  AMS-LaTeX source files --- c:\emtex\latex\packages\amslatex

Macintosh/Textures:

  LaTeX input files area --- Folder `TeX inputs' or bullet+`LaTeX'
  AMS-LaTeX source files --- Folder `AMS-LaTeX' in `Textures' folder

Unix:

  LaTeX input files area --- /texmf/tex/latex/inputs/amslatex
  AMS-LaTeX source files --- /texmf/tex/latex/packages/amslatex

OpenVMS (VAX and Alpha AXP):

  LaTeX input files area --- tex_root:[tex.latex]
  AMS-LaTeX source files --- tex_root:[tex.latex.packages.amslatex]

All other files in the AMS-LaTeX distribution (the ones in the `math'
and `classes' subdirectories) can be placed in an AMS-LaTeX source files
area; if you are installing AMS-LaTeX on a new system, you may need
to create a new folder or directory for this purpose.

TESTING

For a quick test of the installation, try printing the test file
subeqn.tex. For more extensive tests print the AMS-LaTeX user's
guide (amsldoc.tex) or testmath.tex.

NOTES FOR USERS OF AMS-LaTeX 1.1:

Some AMS-LaTeX 1.1 users whose TeX implementation has relatively limited
memory capacities may not be able to use AMS-LaTeX 1.2. For example,
there is an upper limit of 3500 control sequence names (hash size) in
emTeX's tex286. This was marginally sufficient for LaTeX 2.09 +
AMS-LaTeX 1.1, but is not enough for current LaTeX + AMS-LaTeX 1.2.

Support for LaTeX's `compatibility mode'---that is, reproducing exactly
the same results as version 1.1 for existing documents that use
\documentstyle instead of \documentclass---is incomplete. Most
compatibility-mode documents should run through without error messages
at least, but there will be some observable differences in the results.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Many thanks to David M. Jones for contributing the changes needed in the
amsmath package to support `flush-left equations' (the fleqn option),
and for overhauling align, alignat, and related environments to fix a
number of miscellaneous problems with equation number placement.

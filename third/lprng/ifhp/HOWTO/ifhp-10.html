<H2><A NAME="s10">10. Accounting</A></H2>

<P>In Academic institutions, avoiding printing accounting has been
regarded as a challenge,  an ongoing game of fat cat and poor starving
mouse, between the Adminstration and the downtrodden, poor, overcharged
student.  The following is a lighthearted ramble down the dark lane of
printing accounting.
<P>We will disregard the fact that if most students put as much effort
into their studies as in finding ways to avoid accounting procedures
then they would be Rhodes Scholar material,  but I digress...
<H2><A NAME="ss10.1">10.1 Page Accounting Algorithm</A>
</H2>

<P>The accounting procedures put into the LPRng and the ifhp filters may
appear to be extraordinarily complex,  but believe me, they are not.
Firstly, we make the assumption that the printer has some sort of
non-volatile page counter mechanism that is reliable and impervious to
power on/off cycles.  Without this mechanism the enterprising student
ummm... user will simply turn off the printer.  Software that prescans
jobs for line counts and pages is notoriously unreliable,  given even
the most modest efforts of users to hide these procedures.   The cost
of running a PostScript simulator simply to do accounting has its
flaws; without ensuring that the simulator has all of the interesting
security loopholes closed, such as opening files, etc.,  it can become
a trap door to hell for the system administrator.
<P>Secondly,  we must make the assumption that the student... uhhh...
user will not be able to tinker with the page counter mechanism, i.e.-
they will not be able to roll back the odometer on the printer,
<I>for the duration of a single job</I>.
I will digress and point out that a student
actually did this for a challenge;  it only took him a couple of weeks
of study and a fully equipped microcontroller lab, and two (2) laser
printers which he ruined in the experiment.
HP was not amused when we
sent them back under warranty,  claiming that this our 'normal lab usage.'
<P>Lastly,  you should not mind a small amount of pilferage, or a few
pages here and there being charged to the wrong account.
<P>The basic mechanism the ifhp filter uses is to record the page
counter value at the start and end of each part of a print job. Each
record has the form:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
start -qpagecounter ....
end  -ppages -qpagecounter -telapasedtime ....
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>When we use the OF filter and/or banners,  we will see the
individual jobs bracketed by the OF filter records:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
start -q100 -Fo -kcfA100taco -uuser -hhost -R...  
start -q101 -Ff -kcfA100taco -uuser -hhost -R...  
end  -p1 -q102 -Ff -kcfA100taco -uuser -hhost -R...  
start -q102 -Ff -kcfA100taco -uuser -hhost -R...
end  -p3 -q105 -Ff -kcfA100taco -uuser -hhost -R...  
end  -p5 -q105 -Fo -kcfA100taco -uuser -hhost -R...
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It should be clear from the above that all we need to do is to add up
the values for the -Fo (OF) filter lines and we are done.
<P>Unfortunately,  this is too simplistic.  If for some reason the job is
killed or terminates due to error conditions,  the OF filter may not
get to finish its work.  Thus,  we may see the following:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
start -q100 -Fo -kcfA100taco -uuser -hhost -R...  
start -q101 -Ff -kcfA100taco -uuser -hhost -R...  
start -q110 -Fo -kcfA101taco -uuser -hhost -R...
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This is a clear indication that the user's job has been terminated.  In
this case we need to use the differences between pagecounters of the start
records to do accounting.
<P>There is a caveat to all of this;  that is the problem of the last dead
job in the list.  If the last line in the accounting file is:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
start -q110 -Fo -kcfA101taco -uuser -hhost -R...
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

is the last job finished or did it abort?
<H2><A NAME="ss10.2">10.2 You Used 2000 Pages, Out of Quota</A>
</H2>

<P>Now we move on to the problem of real time accounting.  Due to limited
budgets, etc., many institutions would like to strictly enforce limits
on paper use by students. As jobs are printed their accounts should be
docked for the amount of paper use.  One way to do this is to have an
external accounting procedure update a shared database.  The
ifhp
filter
has provision for a shell script to be invoked
at the start and end of print job;
this is done by both the OF and IF filter.  Thus, we can blithely
assume that there is a central database carefully getting updates
from the LPRng software, probaly from dozens of different printers,
and updating the accounting information,
and that this program can query the database,
check limits,
and terminate printing if the limits are exceeded.
<P>The first question to be asked is simple:  is this worth it?
Perhaps doing accounting as a batch job once an hour/four times
a day/once a day is cheaper than buiding an running such a database.
If it costs $5K/year for the database software, you might just consider
ignorng the 10,000 pages that get lost in the shuffle and use
a simple set of awk/sed/perl scripts to update a database once
an hour.
<H2><A NAME="ss10.3">10.3 Bad Jobs - Who Do We Bill?</A>
</H2>

<P>We inevitably run into an interesting question:
what happens if a job does not complete correctly?
<P>If you use the completion of the OF filter as a success status, I have
to point out that many students... ummm... users soon find ways to send
jobs to the printer that will cause it to lock up after their output
has been printed. These jobs require power cycling of the printer and
restarting the filter; a bit extreme, perhaps, but it has happened.
<P>I suggest that you simply adopt a 'bill to last user of record'
attitude,  using the pagecount information as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
start OF -- starting point for THIS job
start IF --  nice information, but not useful
start IF --
end OF -- ending point for this job - can record infomaiton

start OF --
if no end OF for previous job,  then treat as end OF and
          update accounting.
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Now somebody is sure to complain that they got charged for a bunch of
pages that they did not use.  This is inevitable;  always carry a
can of oil for the squeaky wheels.  I might make the observation that
once is accident, twice is coincidence, but three times is malice;
be wary of the constant complainer and check out not only him but
also his co-workers.
<H2><A NAME="ss10.4">10.4 How Do We Update The Database</A>
</H2>

<P>I suggest that database update be done as follows:
maintain a 'last page reported' record for each printer in the
database.
<P>When a successful job reports in,  check to see that the recorded pagecount
for the printer is in agreement with the one that is reported.
<P>If this is not the case then you have had some unsuccessful jobs.
In this case I strongly recommend that you have a means to request the
accounting reporting program to go back through the accounting file and
find the last report for the page counter value and try to backtrack
through the accounting files.  The accounting file is one of the first
things to be attacked by students... Ummm...  users.  It should NOT be
kept on and NFS exported or mounted file system.  It should be
carefully pruned and copied, perhaps on an hourly basis.
<P>Now some adminstrators have fallen in love with network based printers;
do not believe ANYTHING that comes over a network connection without
some form of authentication;  PGP has some very nice Public Key
mechansims for handling this.  This is a major weakness in using a
database for keeping track of accounting - a weak authentication
mechanism may lead to denial of service attacks by students flooding
the database with bogus print usage reports;  suddenly NOBODY can print
and the adminstrator is driven to turning off accounting.
<P>Good luck.  I am never suprised when I encounter yet another wrinkle in
this area.
<H2><A NAME="ss10.5">10.5 Accounting Shell Script</A>
</H2>

<P>The 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
accounting=/pathname
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

specifies a program to run
at the start and end of the
<CODE>ifhp</CODE> activity.
For an example of a simple script,
see the accounting.sh script in the distribution.
<H2><A NAME="ss10.6">10.6 Pagecounter Values</A>
</H2>

<P>The only reliable way to do page counting in the face of
PostScript,
PCL,
and other mystical printer job languages is to query the printer
and get the current value of a hardware page counter.
Unfortuately,
this may not be a trivial matter.
<OL>
<LI>The page counter may not be updated in real time.
This means that you may need to wait a couple of seconds until you are
sure that the pages have been recorded.
Usually this occurs when the pages leave the print engine
and are put in the output tray.</LI>
<LI>Printers do job batching,
and when they report job completion the job is still being printed.</LI>
<LI>Some printers report
<I>impressions</I>,
i.e.- sides of pages printed,
rather than pages.
If you are doing duplex printing then you may find that your
paper count and your page (impression) count differ.</LI>
<LI>Some printers simply lack page reporting.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Given these problems,
it is more than reasonable to reconsider the need for accounting,
or to work closely with the printer vendor to understand the
interactions of print jobs and reporting of page counts.

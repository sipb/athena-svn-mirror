Contents of this package
========================
The directories within this package are arranged as follows:

gnopi       : this  directory   contains the  user  interface  program,  called 
	      'gnopernicus'. This  program  will  configure  all  settings  in  the
	      gnopernicus module. 
braille     : libbrl is a SO ( shared object ) which accepts input in BML ( Braille 
	      Markup Language, a XML  dialect  developed @ Baum)  and  drives  many  
	      known Braille devices ( currently  just a couple of Baum  devices are  
	      supported ).BML supports multiple language translation tables, mixing 
	      of text and dots, different  Braille  and  cursor  styles etc. libbrl 
	      also produce an input stream from the Braille device tothe client.See 
	      brl_*_test.xml for BML examples.
              Note : The user needs rw access to the serial port in order to use it.
srlow       : There are two subdirectories in srlow : libsrlow and test.
	      libsrlow : contains code that  monitors  events  in system. From this 
	      events  collects   necessary  informations  and  notifies  registered
	      clients .
	      test : this directory contains examples of how libsrlow could be used 
	      in application.
srcore      : srcore - is a console application which implements the Screen Reader/
	      Magnifier logic. It  gets  the  input from at-spi through srlow, 
	      keyboard, braille  and  speech  devices  and  produces output  for 
	      Braille, Speech and Magnifier. The output is  produced as XML streams. 
	      This is  a very very very early release.  Basicaly, just a proof of 
	      concept.
srconf      : Added a libsrconf  modules  which  is  working  like  a  proxy for SR 
	      configuration. If you want to test this module, run test   executable 
	      which  simulates writing in configuration file, and run testlibsrconf 
	      which sets a callback for configrution and prints the events.
kbd_mouse   : For the moment there are two subdirectories in it: libke and test.
	      libke: contains the keylistener code. The key listener translates the
	      key or key-combinations to a string. There are three operation modes
	      available: letter mode, word mode and auto mode. At the moment it 
	      listens only to normal characters and by default is set to auto mode. 
	      The key listener settings can be changed via Gconf by using either 
	      gnopi or the test from srconf.
	      test : contains a simple test program (can be used like the simple-at)
speech      : this is an early release of the screen reader speech components.Parts 
	      of it will migrate in the gnome-speech component.
	      Note : festival-server should be running in order to run the tester.
	      (festival --server fvlinit OR festival-server &)
magnifier   : this is an early release of the screen reader magnifier component.
	      There are two subdirectories in magnifier : libmag and test.
	      libmag : is a SO ( shared object ) which accepts input in MML (Mag 
	      Markup Language, a XML  dialect  developed by Baum ) and parses it,   
	      creating  or  modifying  the zoomes according to the properties in 
	      *.xml.
	      test : this directory contains examples of how libmag could be used 
	      in application. An  xml file is parsed and the attributes are spe-
	      cifying the properties of the zoomer (the zoomer is individualized 
	      by an ID ) : parameters, region of interest, zoomer placement. 
	      For the moment there is only one zoomer that is modified (region 0 
	      from AT_SPI), but there is support code for multizoomers.
	      Note : Headers for libat-util.so must be installed.
brlmon	    : this directory  contains a  braille device monitor  and  the  tester. 
	      Braille device monitor is a window in which the text and commands,
	      which are sent by srcore to braille, appear in ASCII mode. The text 
	      which appears is the same whith the xml from braille.The brlmon can
	      be launch when gnopernicus runs. CTRL-F is the shortcut for change the 
	      display font. It is necesary the braille 14 font to be installed. 
	      (This font has only 94 characters, the characters with utf8 will be not
	      display in braille mode).
schemas	    : this directory contains schemas for gnopernicus.
srutil	    : here is a ashared object that is used almost by every component
	      of gnopernicus (a set of common functions)
docs        : this directory contains documentation for the SRLow. Documentation is
	      currently limited to API documentation for the C bindings API, and is 
	      built from sourcesvia the 'gtk-doc' system.

	http://mielke.cc/brltty/doc/Gnopernicus.txt
	for information on gnopernicus & BRLTTY)
	
Building, compiling and installing/uninstalling
===============================================

A. Building
-----------
To compile gnopernicus  on your system, you will need to take several steps to setup 
the tree for compilation.  You can do all these steps at once by running:

    $ ./autogen.sh
    OR
    $ ./configure
  
Basically this does the following for you:

    $ aclocal; automake; autoconf

    The above commands create the "configure" script. Now you can run the configure 
    script to create  all the Makefiles.

Before  running  autogen.sh or configure, make sure you have GNUTools in your path.
(GNUTools = automake, autoconf,libtool etc. For more information visit www.gnu.org)

    Note that autogen.sh  runs configure for you.  If you wish to pass options like  
--prefix=/opt/gnome-2.0 to configure  you  can give those options to autogen.sh and 
they will be passed on to configure.
    You can specify to compile with or without magnifier support by using
--enable-magnifier=yes/no option.

B. Compiling
------------
    $ make

C. Installing
-------------
    $ make install
    
D. Uninstalling
---------------    
    $ make uninstall
    
    Read more about building/installation in the INSTALL file.

Running gnopernicus
===================

*************
* IMPORTANT *
*************
    NUMLOCK key should be ON, otherwise gnopernicus can have an unexpected
    behaviour.

The following applications can be launched :
    * gnopernicus (main application; it has a GUI)
    * srcore	  (same application as gnopernicus, but without GUI)
    * brlmonitor  (Braille Monitor : on screen braille display;
		   shows you what is displayed/would be displayed on a 
		   Braille Display)

*********
* Note1 * 
*********
	It is NOT recommended to use voices from festival together with viavoice
	or FreeTTS voices because the first type of voices don't support speech
	markers. The lack of the markers implicates that not the entire presentation 
	chunk will be spoken.
	If you STILL want to use festival voices you can, BUT they should be 
	the same voice (ex Kevin for all voices that should present a role OR 
	these voices should be at the end of the chunk).
	Example:
	if the presentation chunk for push-button looks like this:
	    %name<voice=name>%
	    %role<voice=role>%
	    %?shortcut?"shortcut":""<voice=system>?%
	    %shortcut<voice=shortcut>%
	make sure that you use a similar combination:
    	    name voice	- Kevin | Kal | ViaVoice voice | ViaVoice voice | Viavoice/FreeTTS
	    role voice	- Kevin | Kal | Viavoice voice | ViaVoice voice | Viavoice/FreeTTS	
	    system voice- Kevin | Kal | Kevin	       | Kal/ViaVoice   | Viavoice/FreeTTS
  	    system voice- Kevin | Kal | Kevin	       | Kal            | Viavoice/FreeTTS

	THIS IS TEMPORARY AND SHOULD BE SOLVED SOON (in gnopernicus/gnome-speech).
*********
* Note2 * 
*********
	If the srcore process exits with an error, gnopernicus shows a warning 
	message in the terminal and sends a beep to notify the user. 
*********
* Note3 * 
*********
	Due to some changes, gnopernicus application might NOT RESPOND to the 
	commands if you had it on your system before.
	
	THIS IS TEMPORARY AND SHOULD BE SOLVED SOON.
	
	Please follow the instructions bellow to "erase" the default keys 
	written in gconf if this is happening to you:
*********
* Note4 * 
*********
	Events can be reported to user on a timer or on a idle callback.
	Also reporting events to user can be forced. Reason to do that is that
	user want to have feedback from gnopernicus in case of quickly actions.
	All these settings can be setted using GNOPERNICUS_TIMER. Valid values
	are "idle" and "timer" Every of these values can be used in association
	with "force" to report events for feedback in case of quickly actions.
	eg: GNOPERNICUS_TIMER=timer
	    GNOPERNICUS_TIMER=idle:force
	In case that this varaible is not defined,the default value is "idle".
*********
* Note5 * 
*********
	Gnopernicus is able to create a log with events received, processed
	and reported to user. To use this facility you should set environment
	variable GNOPERNICUS_LOG. Valid values are "at-spi", "gnopernicus",
	"reentrancy". Any combination of these values is a valid one.
	-- "at-spi" value will log all events, execpt event for terminal objects
	    received from at-spi
	-- "gnopernicus" value will log all event reported by gnopernicus to 
	    user
	-- "reentrancy" value will report all events received from at-spi, events
	    which are caming while another event is processed.
*********
* Note6 *
*********
	At make install it tried to install the braille font in standar font path
	(/usr/share/fonts/default/Type1). If the font installation is failed or 
	the standard font path is other then /usr/share/fonts/default/Type1, you 
	can specify a new font path using --with-default-fonts-path=DIR parameters 
	at configure. (in RedHat linux the default fonts path could be a 
	/usr/share/fonts/default/Type1 or in a user home directory the ~/.fonts 
	directory). If you install a gnopernicus as user copy the braille font in 
	~/.fonts directory and type a command "mkfontdir ~/.fonts" .
*********
* Note7 *
*********
	Command layers and user defined key combinations will work properly 
	ONLY if	NumLock key is turned ON. Also modifiers are reported 
	more than once with NumLock turned off.

The GConf daemon can be running after when all application is stoped whose use
gconf. You can stop with gconftool-2 --shutdown

Steps:
1. Go to your home directory.
$ cd

2. Test if gconfd-1 or gconf-2 is running.
$ ps -aux | grep gconfd 

If running
$ gconftool-2 --shutdown

Now the lock files can be deleted.

3. If ~/.gconf/%gconf-xml-backned.lock and ~/.gconfd/lock directorys exists:
$ gconftool-2 --shutdown
Repeat step 3  until the lock files are removed.

4. Go to ~/.gconf/apps
$ cd ~/gconf/apps

5. Delete gnopernicus directory from gconf.
$ rm -f -R ./gnopernicus

In this case if the lockfiles does not exist delete only the 
/.gconf/apps/gnopernicus directorie tree. (Step 3)
And try to run gnopernicus.
If the gnopernicus prefix is not same with the gconf prefix you need to set in
{sysconfdir}/gconf/2/path of gconf the path where the schemas were installed.
(Copy and modify last line of this file).

files can be found at:

Using gnopernicus
=================
This is  a  brief description  of the current Gnopernicus features mapping and 
GUI's options. For more details visit 

	www.baum.ro/gnopernicus.html

A. gnopernicus feature mapping
-----------------------------
1. Touch  sensors  reaction: the action that take place when  a touch sensor is
pressed  is  working  according  with  the "gnopernicus" configuration (Braille
Settings/Position Sensors  dialog). As  for  now, these  following  actions are
available:

- mouse move
- mouse move and left click
- mouse move and right click

The text attributes are presented on speech all the time.


2.Keypad Layers

Gnopernicus functions are mapped on fixed keys on numeric keypad. Because the 
number of keys on numeric keypad is limted, the "layer concept" is introduced.
That means that a key can have multiple meanings, depending on which layer is 
the user is.
Now there are 11 layers available, from 0 to 10. To swith between them you have
to press 0 key from numeric keypad, folowed in 5 seconds by the layer number,
or DEL key for layer 10.

NOTE: NumLock key must be pressed!!!

If you don't press a layer number in 5 seconds, then gnopernicus will not change
the current layer.

NOTE: If it stress the layers, (press fast the keys or not release a numpad key 
before to press other numpad key), it can be possible to get a side effects
from the applications (to speak "switch window" or to lose a focus). 

For now, proposal mapped layers are:

(X --- means that this function is working)
(* --- this function is just mapped. It has no real effect)

LAYER 0: (navigation layer)
    1 - goto toolbar			X
    2 - goto child/goto next line	X
    3 - goto statusbar			X

   14 (*) - goto last			X
   15 (/) - goto first			X
   In flat review mode the following keys have other functions (for the moment 
   the command string is the same as above, but the functionality differs)
    1 - present last line in flat review (bottom of the context)
    2 - presnet next line (down)
    3 - present line containg focused object
    4 - scroll to the left on braille device (inside the current line)
    5 - |

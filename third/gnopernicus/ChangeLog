	* gnopi/gnopernicus.in:
	Added. From this "template", the gnopernicus script will be generated.
	The new 'gnopernicus' script is acting exactly like the formal 
	'gnopernicus' binary, meaning that is accepting the same parameters.
	
	* configure.in:	
	* gnopi/Makefile.am:
	Changed name of 'gnopernicus' binary into 'gnopernicus.bin'.
	Created the 'gnopernicus' script in order to launch the GUI with a11y
	gtk-modules loaded in, so gnopernicus.bin application will always be 
	accessible. This is needed because of the accessibility key (the gconf 
	key that needs to be set in order to turn accessibility ON). If gnopernicus
	wouldn't load the a11y libraries (this would be/is possible only at 
	start-up time) the dialogs that announce the user that the key is OFF 
	wouldn't be "visible" for the blind user.
	Being a screen reader, the only one tool that allows the blind user to
	interact with the desktop, gnopernicus needs to be always accessible,
	and not to alterate the environment without user's approvement.

	(Automake needs to know the list of files that are intended to be 
	compiled statically. In adition the EXTRA_* variable supports dist_ and 
	nodist_ prefix; dist_ is redundant) 

	* srcore/Makefile.am:
	Get rid of temp.xml from EXTRA_DIST, as this file does NOT exist anymore.

	(Braille Settings / Braille Device)
	The  switches  for  turning  on/off  Braille, Speech  and  Magnifier in 
	General Settings (Gnopernicus UI) are  now  active. However, due to the 
	fact that the speech module is not discarded properly, de-activation of
	speech output  means  only  not  using  speech, not also discarding the 
	speech component. We work on it.

2002-03-18 Iuliu Szijjarto <is@baum.ro>

	dinamically  via  srconf (gconf) for  keys  to  be listened. There were
	defined  some  key  categories  that  can be enabled/disabled. Also the 
	SR_EVENT_KEYBOARD_ECHO listens  only  to  characters, which  are useful
	when editing in a text box. Finally, some fixies was made in KE_Timeout
	feature and the debug strings were eliminated.

	initializations  of  the struct termios memebers ( this is the internal 
	functionality of cfmakeraw ). 
	Note : This function was not redundant.
	

2002-03-14 Bill Haneman <bill.haneman@sun.com>

        * braille/libbrl/sercomm.c: 
        Fixes to allow compilation using gcc on Solaris:
	- removed (unused) #include of "error.h",which is non-portable.
	- commented out non-standard (non-Posix)call to cfmakeraw (it looks as 
	though it may be redundant here anyway; I suggest perhaps a Posix.1 
	termios call instead).
	- changed fcntl flag FNDELAY to O_NONBLOCK, my guess as to what you meant
	here.(Posix only allows O_NONBLOCK, O_APPEND, O_SYNC, and O_ASYNC in 
	this context).

	the source of the event.

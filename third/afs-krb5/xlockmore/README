How to build?
-------------
    An ANSI C compiler is now required for build.

    Check below to see if your machine is one mentioned that causes
    problems, otherwise it should be easy.

    Do you have XPM?  If so, uncomment "#define XpmLibrary" of Imakefile.
    Do you have Motif?  If so, uncomment "#define XmLibrary" of Imakefile.
    Do you have MESAGL?  If so, uncomment "#define GLLibrary" of Imakefile.
    Do you have CDE?  If so, uncomment "#define DtSaverLibrary" of Imakefile.
    Do you have RPLAY?  If so, uncomment "#define RplayLibrary" of Imakefile.

    If you are using X11R6 then:
        xmkmf
        make depend
        make
        ./xlock -mode life3d

    If you are using X11R5 or less then:
        xmkmf
        make
        ./xlock -mode life3d

    Note: if you don't have 'xmkmf' or the "Makefile" it generates
    doesn't work well, edit Makefile.std for appropriate settings for
    XINCLUDEPATH and XLIBPATH, then try:
        make -f Makefile.std
        ./xlock -mode life3d


Likely Problems
---------------
  xlock: user/passwd error -> this usually means you should get your
    administrator to setuid xlock to root or at least setgid xlock to
    shadow.  See recommendation for your OS.

  AIX (IBM RS6000)
    AIX's "make":
      AIX's "make" can not handle "+=" so if you use the Imakefile, you
      have to group all your DEFINES into one long line and use "="
      instead.  GNU's "make" solves this problem.
    AIX 3.1 and less:
      it SHOULD compile automatically with -DLESS_THAN_AIX3_2 using the
      Imakefile, since the passwd struct is not available.
    AIX 3.2 and greater:
      one must have setuid xlock to root if you want to use it
      without being root.
    AFS users:
      See Imakefile, grep on "AFS". 
    Some machines have an alternate password shadowing method, if someone  
      figures it out mail me the patch.

  Alpha-OSF/1 (Digital Equipment Corp)

    Enhanced security:
      Compile with -DOSF1_ENH_SEC see Imakefile
        chown auth.auth xlock
        chmod 2755 xlock
      Unfortunately the following is reportedly broken since xlockmore-2.10
      and needs a patch, I heard it produces the following at runtime.
Unaligned access pid=1767 <xlock> va=140489e24 pc=3ff807d9978 ra=3ff807d9880
type=ldq
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

  Apollo (HP)
    Shift-Control-Break is caught.  See HP.

  CDE (DT)
    (My heart bleeds for you.)
    Common Desktop Environment.  Go to the CDE DT CONFIG SECTION of the
      Imakefile and uncomment
XCOMM #define DtSaverLibrary
    Then run xlock with the -dtsaver option.

  DCE authentication (tested only on HP's)
    See Imakefile or one of the makefiles.
    
  ESIX
    Similar to Solaris2.x.  You will need a -DSVR4 to compile.
    chmod 440 /etc/shadow
    if you get libX11.so.xxx not found
      link with the static versions of the X libraries 
    chmod 2755 xlock

  FreeBSD
    One may have to setuid xlock to root (are there any objections?).
    Also see "XFree86" if applicable.

  GL
    So far I just assume the Mesa 3-D Graphics Library.  See below on
      availability.  Follow its instructions and then go to Imakefile
      and uncomment
XCOMM #define GLLibrary
    So far only the gear mode uses it.

  HP
    Shift-Control-Break is caught.  This uses a library Xhp11 that may
      not exist on some systems.  Comment out
        XHPDisableReset(dsp);
      and
        XHPEnableReset(dsp);
      in "xlock.c" if you do not have this library.
      May have to setuid xlock to root.
    The optimizer may break utils.c .
    HP's "make":
      HP's "make" can not handle "+=" so if you use the Imakefile, you
      have to group all your DEFINES into one long line and use "="
      instead.  GNU's "make" solves this problem.
    HP-UX with Secured Passwords:
      Compile with -DHPUX_SECURE_PASSWD and setuid xlock to root.
    HP-UX with Passwd Etc:
      Compile with -DHP_PASSWDETC .
      Link with -lrgy -lnck -lndbm .

  IRIX (SGI)
    No problem.  :)

  KERBEROS
    See Imakefile or one of the makefiles.
    
  Linux (Intel 80386, 80486, & Pentium)
    If you are using elf _or_ shadow passwords:
        xlock should compile with -DHAS_SHADOW
    If you are _not_ using elf and are using shadow passwords:
      (this old version has a known security flaw)
        link with -lshadow -lgdbm
    Next if using shadow passwords:
        chown root.root xlock  (or root.shadow if it exists)
        chmod 4755 xlock
      (chmod 2755 xlock may be better if shadow has group read for root group)
    Also check that the following was done:
        Your /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/config/linux.cf should have
#define HasShadowPasswd         YES
        This would let the Imakefile work automatically for compile/link.
        This is forced already in xlock.h if you have elf.
        chown root.root /etc/shadow   (or root.shadow if it exists)
        chmod 400 /etc/shadow
      (chmod 440 /etc/shadow may be better).
    So far, Slackware (a major Linux distribution) does NOT come with shadow
      passwords standard.  If you want to install shadow passwords (be
      careful, it can be tricky) it's on sunsite.unc.edu in
      /pub/Linux/system/Admin .
    Also see "XFree86" if applicable.

  Linux (Alpha)
    Change the order of XLIB and XPMLIB in the Imakefile so the XPMLIB
     comes first.  Intel stuff above probably applies as well.

  Rplay
    Audio package.  See below on availability.  Follow its instructions and
      then go to Imakefile and uncomment
XCOMM #define RplayLibrary
      See config directory for example.  (Note: The example files are
      concerned with getting it working ... not security).

  Solaris2.x (Sun SPARC)
    Imake will compile with the -DHAS_SHADOW switch.
    With GNU's gcc, get rid of the "-ansi" during compilation, also
      one may want to get rid of the -xF references in
      /usr/openwin/lib/config/sun.cf and Imake.tmpl if you get a
      cc: language F not recognized
    Solaris2.x NIS+ or not using NIS (/etc/passwd):
      Setuid xlock to root to get encrypted password (chmod u+s xlock).
        For some reason when this is done ld can not find -lXext .
        See EXTENSIONLIB commented out in the Imakefile.

  SunOS4.1.x (Sun Sparc & 680x0)
    Put in a link from /usr/include/X11 to your ${OPENWINHOME}/include/X11
      to use the Imakefile or use the Makefile.sun provided.
 
  Ultrix (DEC)
    I heard that the logout button just kills xlock.
    USE_XLOCKRC feature unimplemented, but may not be hard to do.
    xlock must be either setuid root or setgid authread to validate the
      password on an Ultrix system.

  VMS (DEC)
    All you should need to do to build the executable is:
      move all file from the VMS directory one up and run the make.com file:
        $ rename [.vms]*.* []
        $ @make
    To run xlock a symbol needs to be defined, for example:
        XLOCK:==$H268SYSEXE:XLOCK
      where H268SYSEXE is a logical name pointing to the directory where
      XLOCK.EXE resides. The '$' after == means this is a foreign command
      and VMS makes the command line available to the program.
    @make may bomb out with the shape.c bitmaps.  The bitmaps distributed
      by DEC are corrupt, so you need to remove the nulls at the end of each
      file in question.  If you do not have privledges, uncomment CORRUPT_VMS
      in shape.c .
    If the link bombs out I recommend trying it again like the following:
        $ @make clean
        $ @make
    -allowroot only works if you have SYSPRV enabled which is a bit limiting.
      Unless one uses the priveledged install by a system manager.  To do
      this, the following command needs to be executed at system startup
      (i.e. included in systartup_vms.com):
         INSTALL ADD {dev}:[{dir}]XLOCK.EXE/PRIV=(SYSPRV)
      where {dev}:[{dir}] is the full path of the executable.
    The XLock file normally in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults needs to be in the
      directory DECW$SYSTEM_DEFAULTS on VMS systems and be called
      'DECW$XLOCK.DAT'.
    USE_XLOCKRC, AUTO_LOGOUT, LOGOUT_BUTTON, & MULTIPLE_ROOT features
      are not implemented.
    To use audio:
      It is automatically linked for VMS/ALPHA. To get it work on a VAX some
      editing of the make.com is needed (scan for VMS_PLAY)
      The default sound files are hard coded to be in the current directory
        see line 128 or so of the resource.c file but can be overruled from
        the command line or the resourcefile decw$xlock.dat.
      Sounds did not work for me on the VAX.
      It should work OK on an AXP. (Due to a bug in the SO driver on some
        models running VMS7.0, sounds are only available on the headset).
    To use new event loop:
       For VMS7.0 and higher : new event loop is used by default.
         You do not need to install extra software.
       For VMS6.2 or lower :
         You need some UNIX utilities installed (XVMSUTILS).  See where to get
         it below.
         Look at the make.com and xvmsutil stuff.

  XFree86
    Control-Alt-Backspace will defeat locking mechanism and return your
      console back unless you put "DontZap" in your XF86Config file.
      (In X11R5, that would be a "dontzap" in your Xconfig file).
    Control-Alt-F1 (among others) will defeat locking mechanism with
      virtual terminals. This is not too good, right?  If you are using
      Linux, try vlock on tsx-11.mit.edu in /pub/linux/sources/usr.bin .
      The current XFree86 (as far as I know) does not have a server
      extension for catching or disabling VT switching.  Any ideas?

  XPM
    Full color pixmap package.  See below on availability.  Follow its
       instructions and then go to Imakefile and uncomment
XCOMM #define XpmLibrary

  X-Terminal
    (My heart bleeds for you.)
    To get xlock to run, run with -remote option or set XLock.remote on
    in XLock.ad .  You might have to use -allowaccess as well.
        
  tvtwm
    One used to get following error when running xlock (+nolock) with
      tvtwm.
    X Error of failed request:  BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)
    What happens is that RootWindow(dsp, screen) fails when tvtwm is
      running.  There is a kludge fix, but multiscreens will not work
      right with tvtwm and xlock. (grep on TVTWM in xlock.c).
    Another option, don't compile with -DUSE_VROOT .  If you debug it
      mail ME -OR- both the author of tvtwm and ME the patch. 
    StickyAbove problems:
      Windows in a tvtwm that have "StickyAbove" set to true are still
      visible when xlock (+inroot) is running. If this bothers you,
      don't compile with -DUSE_VROOT .  Is it possible to have xlock
      set "StickyAbove" to true as well? 

  fvwm
    -install does not install colormaps.  fvwm will not allow an
    application to install its own colormap.  You could always edit the
    source if you have it, (fvwm-1.24r)colormaps.c, where it says 
 if(ReInstall)
   {
     XInstallColormap(dpy,last_cmap);
   }
    make sure this does not happen.

  swirl mode
    Use with -install to see colormap change.
    See "fvwm" if applicable.
    "swirl" cycles its colors, except black and white.
    This is easily seen when on a color monitor one enters:
       ./xlock -mode swirl -inwindow -install
    now move the mouse in the window.
    If you find this annoying compile swirl.c with -DFORCEFIXEDCOLORS.
    I hear it LOCKS UP on i386BsdArchitecture and tvtwm.
    With twm (and fvwm see above) the colormap does not change.


Personal Use
------------
  You may want to compile with USE_XLOCKRC .  xlock will then prompt
  you the first time you use it for a password.  It is then encrypted
  and stored in your $HOME/.xlockrc file.  This is also good for
  users who have an unrecognized shadow password environment.  See
  Imakefile or a Makefile for an example.  Please note that it may
  be rude to use xlock in a lab environment.

Lab Environment
---------------
  The auto logout feature, when enabled, will log out a user after
  30 minutes (by default).  The timeout can be changed or disabled
  with a command-line option (or x resource -- this is allowed because
  the logout button can always be used; see below).  The time
  remaining before auto-logout is displayed on the password entry
  screen.
 
  The logout button, when enabled, is a button that appears on the
  password entry screen after 5 minutes (configurable at
  compile-time) that, when clicked, logs out the user.  The rationale
  for this thing is that in a lab environment, we wanted a way for
  users to be able to reliably lock their display for short periods
  of time, but still be allowed to have the display locked for longer
  than that if the lab isn't busy.  If the lab IS busy, and there is
  a need for workstations, the logout button can be used to logout
  someone who's been gone for more than 5 minutes.
 
  Of course, the auto-logout and the logout button are
  enabled/disabled by compile-time defines.  All these are OFF by
  default.  One can also force use these features with a local policy
  of exemptions (e.g. username or group). See the Imakefile or a
  Makefile file for an example.  Edit your /etc/xlock.staff file to
  reflect your policy.  If using xdm, you may just want to use
  -DCLOSEDOWN_LOGOUT (or -DSESSION_LOGOUT <- old way) in conjuction
  with -DAUTO_LOGOUT or -DLOGOUT_BUTTON.  That way all backgrounded
  processes owned by a user do not have to be killed.

  Don't PANIC, the auto-logout and the logout button will not run if
  you are root.  Otherwise, it will kill all of root's processes, not
  a good idea.  As long as you do not lock the screen (using -nolock,
  -inwindow, or -inroot) the policy of xlock users does not go into
  affect.


xlock still does not work:  :-(
-------------------------------
  If all that does not work you may need to adjust xlock.h, usleep.c,
  xlock.c, and resource.c since these files are highly implementation
  dependent.  If you have to make this kind of change to get it working,
  let me know.

  You can try compiling with -g and running it with -debug and your
  favorite debugger, so xlock will run in a more friendly way (i.e. it
  does not lock the screen).  There are also may be compile time switches
  that could be turned on with -DDEBUG depending on what is not working
  correctly.  Be aware one mode, puzzle uses XGetImage and this sometimes
  bombs out with a BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes) if moved out of
  view, this should be fixed but it is not a problem except with -inwindow
  or -debug.

  Here is a simple recipe:
    Make sure the 12th line in the Imakefile is a comment
      (This is because the debug library for xpm is not usually installed)
XCOMM #define XpmLibrary
    xmkmf
    edit Makefile  on the line with CC = gcc or or CC = cc change to
               CC = gcc -g -DDEBUG
    make depend
    make
    gdb xlock
    run -debug <other xlock options you want here>
    bt  <-After it bombs out try backtrace
    print <relevant variables>
      (you may have to use "up" to take you to xlockmore code)>
    Mail me the results.

  If xlock crashes for you when in random mode... try this and mail
    me the results.  (If it runs for a long time partial result will do
    (gut the middle part)).
  xlock -mode random -modelist all-puzzle +install -debug -v
    -modelist all-puzzle: puzzle does not like to be moved off screen. 
    -debug: so it does not lock the screen.
    -v: for maximum verbosity.
    +install: so it does not keep changing the colormap


Other things to try: (if you got it working :-) )
-------------------------------------------------

  You may want to compile xlock.c using -DMOUSE_MOTION, then xlock will
  respond to (you guessed it) the motion of the mouse.  This is not
  recommended if you are using a virtual desktop; a default root window
  that may be larger than the physical displayed resolution on your screen.

  If you need to have a window up all the time, even over xlock, you
  need to comment out
                s[0] = '\0';
                return 1;
  in xlock.c after "case VisibilityNotify:".  The window must be able to
  pop itself to the front whenever it gets a visibility event.  Any
  problems here?

  You may want to change the 1st line of XLock.ad "random" to "blank",
  "life", or whatever your favorite is and copy it to
  /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults or $HOME (or wherever your application
  defaults files are) and rename to XLock .

  You may want some of the modes never to come up in random.  This is
  already hard coded blank.  See xlock man page on "modelist".  In
  mode.c you can hard code others by just putting the stuff that you do
  not like in the LockProcs to the end of the static array and in
  random.c increase NUMSPECIAL by the number of new screens that you do
  not want displayed.

  You may want to move xlock into /usr/bin/X11 (or wherever your X
  binaries are). You may also want to move xlock.man to
  /usr/man/man1/xlock.1 .

  If you want to remove some unwanted modes just edit "mode.h" and
  "mode.c" grep the for the unwanted modes.  You might want to edit
  the man page and your favorite make file as well.

  I am always looking to improve life, life3d, and life1d.  If anyone
  knows any new collections (I have lifep.zip (May 94) and xlife 3.0)
  let me know.  If you would like further information let me know.
  life1d and life3d has compile-time options that you may want to
  check out.  Also ant needs new breeds of interesting ants.
  I would like to add a compile time option to allow the exploration of
  certain modes using run time options of certain modes (life, life1d,
  life3d, & ant).  This should be a compile time since it may increase
  the executable size needlessly for normal use.

  Still like xscreensaver better?  (Obscenities omitted ;) ) Try
  setting your apps-defaults file for xscreensaver like:
*programs:      xlock -nolock +grabmouse -mode random
  or if you want to hard code it in, study docs/xlock2xscreensaver.
  You can mail me updates to it, but don't expect me to help you ;) .

  If you want to hack a new mode check out docs/HACKERS.GUIDE.  Then
  when working, just mail it to me, grep on Maintainer for address.

Some open problems:  (Suggestions for this would be nice)
---------------------------------------------------------

  Need a small 3D engine for wire, hidden surface removal, shading, ....

  Should there be a -modegeometry option for each mode instead of
    -gridsize for all modes?
 
  It would be nice to have an option -idletime time.  Where xlock would
    run after a certain idle time.  (Here xautolock may help you, see
    above).

  Modes that contain "MI_PAUSE" do not behave correctly on multiscreens.
  -random does not behave correctly on multiscreens with one mono and one
     color.

  When in -inroot it does not refresh the screen.

  New lockscreens suggestions (some may be very hard :) ):
    "graph" a random planar graph drawn ... filled in by a 5 (or 4 :) )
      coloring algorithm.
    "invert" a demonstration of turning a sphere inside out without creating
      any kinks (two surfaces can occupy the same space at the same time).
      Randomize the viewing angle.
    "minimal" a random minimal surface generator.
    More fractal or automata lockscreens.
    "bubble" lockscreen, maybe something like 2 circles one bigger than
      the other offset and on top of each other but offset to upper right.

  raster files when loaded with -install (for puzzle and image) do not
    preserve foreground, background, or white colors.

  braid and slip should be made so that it can be interrupted quicker.

  Reported that swirl does not swirl on 16 bit per pixel screens.

  In "bounce" sometimes a ball does not roll off another ball.  Momentum
    seems to be created.

  "life3d" draws invisible cubes when it does not have to.  The original
    MS DOS code weeded this out, but it did not seem to port to X.

  "-mode marquee -messagefile filename" truncates a large file.

  flag should have a runtime option for the string displayed.
    flag should use the mfont info to generate fonts.
    flag wave should not always be at the same starting point

  kaleid needs to be triangular.

  extra modes
    Now provided in the hackers directory.  A dozen or so modes among them
     are pacman, bomb, julia.  Some assume XPM.  See hackers/README.hackers
    They are not in their original form, so some do not work right.
    Please resubmit any of these if you clean them up.


Operation: (Blurb taken from Darren Senn's xlock)
------------------------------------------------- 

  Under X, run xlock.  The screen will clear, and some pretty animated
  picture (exactly which depends on which module is active) will appear
  on the screen.  If you hit a key, then the screen will clear, and
  (unless you've changed the application defaults file that I packaged
  with this) you'll get a black screen with some graphics in the top
  center.  These graphics consist of a reduced size image of the module
  you were viewing, the name of the user who executed xlock, and
  password prompt field, and some short instructions.
 
  At this point, you can either click on the graphic to return to xlock,
  or you can type a password.  If the password is verifiable as the
  root password, or the password of the user listed above, then xlock
  will terminate.  THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO STOP XLOCK WITHOUT SHUTTING
  DOWN THE X SERVER.  That's what makes it a lock.

 
Resources: (Also taken from Darren Senn's xlock)
------------------------------------------------
 
  There are two sets of resources for XLock.  The first set are (what I
  call) global XLock resources, while the second set consists of
  module-specific resources.  I'll get more into modules a little further
  below.
 
  The global resources are:
        XLock.mode: This sets the module.  More about this later.
        XLock.font: This is the font used on the password entry screen.
        XLock.background: The background color for the password entry screen.
        XLock.foreground: The foreground color for the password entry screen.

  XLock has a number of modules which it can display.  (See the man page
  for a complete list).  It turns out that each module is characterized
  by a number of initializations, separated by a number of "draws".
  Each module has the following resources defined:

        XLock.<module>.delay: How long to wait between draws (usec)
        XLock.<module>.batchcount: May mean various things (see man page).
        XLock.<module>.cycles: Controls the timeout of screen (see man page).
        XLock.<module>.saturation: Saturation (as in HSV) of colors to use.


Acknowledgments:
----------------

  I did not write the original algorithms in any of the lock screens
  (except wator, bug, life1d, demon, and ant), although I did
  convert many of the new ones to run with xlock.  I tried to follow
  the original style of Patrick Naughton.  Updates are made at
  ftp.x.org in directory /contrib/applications.  Many of the additions
  were "borrowed" from xscreensaver (Jamie Zawinski <jwz@netscape.com>).
  Some of the others were "borrowed" from old demos from Sun.

  I will consider putting new ones in if (1) they are more or less public
  domain (i.e. BSD, sorry no GNU copyrights), (2) they are neat (I am
  biased towards mathematically based programs (especially the Computer
  Recreations of Scientific American)), and (3) I have the time.

  Also many thanks to the people that helped me with the main program
  itself mentioned in "Revisions", especially Heath A. Kehoe.

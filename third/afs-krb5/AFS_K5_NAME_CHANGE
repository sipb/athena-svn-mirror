AFS/K5 NAME CHANGE CODE
=======================

This file details procedures you need to follow in order to use the
AFS-Kerberos 5 migration kit if you are changing the name of your
realm/cell when you migrate from AFS to Kerberos 5.


THE ISSUES
==========

For an AFS-style key, AFS/Kerberos uses the AFS cell name as the salt for
the encryption process. The problem is that when you migrate the
database from AFS to Kerberos 5 there is no way to re-encrypt the key
using the new Kerberos 5 realm name as the salt. This generates two
problems.

The first is that when AFS-style keys are regenerated (e.g. the user
changes their password) they must continue to be encrypted with the
old cell name so that AFS programs, like klog, know how to decrypt
them. (This problem can be worked around to some extent because klog
will attempt to get a V4-style if it cannot successfully decrypt or
retrieve the AFS-style key.)

The second problem is that when Kerberos 5 programs have to deal with
AFS keys they have to know to use the old cell name as the salt
instead of the new realm name.


CHANGES TO THE PROCEDURES
=========================

There are several things you need to do differently in order to make
a successful transition. The following is lays out this changes to the
procedures outlined in the README and other files accompanying this kit.

For the sake of the examples, it's is assumed your old realm (AFS cell)
name is old.cell.name and you new realm (K5) is new.realm.name. The
realms name will be shown in upper or lower case depending on how they
need to be entered. In other words if the example shows the name in
upper case enter it in upper case


Building Kerberos 5
-------------------

After applying the "monster-patch" as specified in the README, when
you run configure you want to enable code to support the name change
by specifying '--with-afs-name-change'. This should be specified in
addition to '--with-afs' and '--with-krb4'.


Creating AFS principal in Kerberos database
-------------------------------------------

aklog will determine that cell name and realm name differ and look for
a afs key with the old realm name as the instance. So when you create
your AFS principal in the Kerberos database you want to call it:

	afs/old.cell.name@NEW.REALM.NAME

instead of just afs@NEW.REALM.NAME.


Running afs2k5db
----------------

When you run afs2k5db you want to specify your old cell name on the
command line with the '-r' options. For example:

afs2k5db -r OLD.CELL.NAME /usr/afs/db/kaserver.DB0

What's not obvious is the function krb5_dbekd_encrypt_key_data() puts
the salt, which in this case is old.cell.name, into the part of the
key data structure (kdc_data_contents[1]) where code in the KDC can
get at it.


Running fakeka
--------------

When you run fakeka you need to specify your old cell name (in upper
case) on the command line with the '-c' option. For example:

fakeka -c OLD.CELL.NAME

Note that in order for fakeka to work, you have to use database
entries imported with afs2k5db. Principals added by other means than
through afs2k5db will not be able to get AFS tokens through fakeka.


Cross-Cell Authentication
-------------------------

Just a note that when you do cross-cell authentication your
username in the remote cell will be user@NEW.REALM.NAME and not
user@OLD.CELL.NAME


CODE CHANGES
============

The following details the changes to the code that are included with
the "monster-patch" and enabled when "--with-afs-name-change" is
specified to configure.


krb524/conv_princ.c
-------------------

Code in krb524d looks at service ticket being requested for
conversion. If the request is for an afs ticket, it has a not null
instance and the realms on the service ticket and requesting user
match, then the instance of the service is copied into it's realm (and
capitalized in the process) and the instance is set to null.

The intent here is that aklog will get a ticket for
afs/old.cell.name@NEW.REALM.NAME and then send it to krb524d to be
converted to a V4 ticket. krb524d will then copy the instance over the
realm and return a V4 ticket for afs@OLD.CELL.NAME


kdc/kdc_preauth.c
-----------------

The code in kdc_preauth.c looks at key_data_contents[1] of the AFS
key and if it does then it is returned as the salt instead of the realm
name. What happens is when afs2k5db moved over the entries it places
the old cell name in this field.

It's non-obvious but in afs2k5db, OLD.CELL.NAME as passed in by the
'-r' flag is placed in key_data_contents[1] by the function
krb5_dbekd_encrypt_key_data().


lib/kdb/kdb_cpw.c
-----------------

The code in kdb_cpw.c checks whenever a user's password is changed to
see if the key_data_contents[1] field contains data and if so uses
that as the salt to encrypt the new key instead of the realm name.

As in afs2k5db the function krb5_dbekd_encrypt_key_data() replaces
OLD.CELL.NAME in key_data_contents[1].

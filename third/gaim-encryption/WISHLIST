Features that would be good to put in, things that should be done better, etc

Cleanup / Modernization:
   There are a bunch of lists and hashmaps, some of which should be consolidated, maybe.

   There are things that have progressed in Gaim that haven't been caught up
   with here yet.  Like Gaim now has an icon "stock", so we probably don't need
   our own anymore (add our icons to Gaim's stock instead).  The config could
   probably be moved into the main gaim config, I think... although I'm not
   sure how well that would work.

Audit:
   Someone should go through the code and audit for security.

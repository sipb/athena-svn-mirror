     2.27    Changes for Gaim 0.79 API.
             Minor bugfixes

     2.26    New lock icons
             Auto-enlarge the default IM window size if plugin has never
               been loaded before
             Don't put icons on chat windows
             Fixes to make compatible with Gaim 0.78 BList API changes
               (Courtesy of Stu Tomlinson)
             Fix to make more compatible with other plugins
               (Courtesy of Casey Ho)      
             Added MSN message length limit.

     2.25    Compatible with new Gaim 0.77 plugin API.
             Fix for bug where old keys were not deleted when regenerated.
             Can now copy key fingerprints to clipboard from dialog.

     2.24    Fixed a bug that caused crash on encrypted message received when no
               window was currently open.

     2.23    Gaim 0.76 now removes or mangles HTML in most protocols.  So, there is
               now a table of what header to use for each protocol, with the default
               being a non-html header.  ICQ is tricky, since AIM does allow HTML,
               and ICQ doesn't.  So ICQ gets the HTML headers, but we check to see
               if they got escaped on the way in to Gaim.  A side effect of all this
               is that it is now safer to have Broadcast/Notify on, since it does
               nothing for most protocols that don't have native HTML.
             Changes to the configuration files to avoid hassles from duplicate
               PACKAGE_XXX vars from the gaim config.h.

     2.22    Now attaches protocol to username, so the plugin doesn't get confused
               if you talk to BoB151 on AIM and BoB151 on MSN.  This also robustifies
               some of the other conversation-finding code, for changing the lock icons,
               for example.  This is a good thing.  Only problem- old keys (in the
               known_keys file) won't have the protocol attached, so users will see
               the "Unknown key" for each buddy.
             Fixes for some crashes in parsing mangled header code.  Thanks to
               Michael Wright for finding the problem.
             Fix for using HKCU vs HKLM rights on Windows install.

     2.21    Another bugfix for updated NSS versions (esp 3.9 that ships with
               Gaim 0.75 on Windows)

     2.20    Bugfix for gcc < 2.7.x
             More config updates and code simplification, courtesy of Daniel Atallah
             Should be functionally identical to 2.19, if 2.19 compiled for you

     2.19    Updated for Gaim API 0.75
             Those API changes allow better startup of NSS, which may solve some problems
               for MSN users.
             Changes to the way config is handled internally (Daniel Atallah)
             Gettext-friendlier code (Daniel Atallah)
             Bugfix for Mozilla 1.6b compatibility             

     2.18    New Windows installer (standalone now).  Thanks Mike Campell and Daniel Atallah
             Detects protocol now, and shortens max message length for conversations on
               Yahoo.  Also estimates message lengths correctly now.
             More defensiveness for buddy list crashes.

     2.17    Added some defensiveness to avoid a crash in Gaim when asking for certain
               buddy info.
	
     2.16    Updated for Gaim API 0.72
             Fix for conversation close of non-buddy -> crash
             Hopeful fix for condition when you recieve a bad nonce
               but don't have a conversation window open for that person
               (caused lost message).

     2.15    Updated for Gaim API 0.71
             Added receive sounds when popping up key dialog boxes.

     2.14    Fixed typo in configure file for folks who need to use --with-nspr-includes

     2.13    Updated calls to send and write functions for changed Gaim API.
             Works with 0.70

     2.12    Updated blist to work with Gaim 0.69
             Added check on compiled vs. running Gaim versions
             Grabbed Gaim configure.ac's section on NSS/NSPR

     2.11    Fix for code that doesn't compile on older gcc

     2.10    Updates to event/signal system (for Gaim 0.68 release)
             Work around bug in gtkblist signal

     2.09    Added Auto-Encrypt feature
             Fixed --with-nss-libs spec

     2.08    Ditto of 2.06 (doh!)

     2.07    Changes to configure system to include "." as an appended
               directory to try.
             Fix for case when user clicks on "No" when asked about
               accepting a key.
             Better handling of queued away messages.  Now, if keys are known ahead
               of time, it should just work.  Conversation windows only get auto-opened
               as a last resort.
             On conversation close, any queued outgoing messages that are awaiting a key
               are now deleted.  This follows what a user would expect, since the message
               hasn't been displayed in the outgoing window yet.
             Refactored widget/capable/tx-rx-encryption-status code.  Not a huge impact
               on behavior at present (except enabling better queued message support).
               Will enable cool new options in the future, like remembering whether to
               encrypt to a given buddy.


     2.06    Oops, some ./configure type files were missing last release.
             No actual changes, just a full release this time.

     2.05    New "standalone" configure system (thanks Jeff Squyres!)
             Updates to make compatible with 0.67

     2.04    Changed broadcast header to break compatibility with 1.x plugin

     2.03    Fixed problems that occured with new accounts.
             Now caches sent messages, and re-sends if there was a nonce problem
               (no more "garbled message" indications if a buddy logs out and logs
                back in in the middle of a conversation).
             Fixed icon problem that caused crashes on some platforms.

     2.02    Fix mem leak/double free.
             Tweak to configure.

     2.01    Fixed Yahoo problem
             Fixed (finally?!?) Jabber problem
             Better configure/makefile stuff, including NSS/NSPR location guessing.

     2.00    Better detection of NSS and NSPR libraries.
             Fixed crash on bad Base64 data.
             Hopefully improved Jabber compatibility.

     2.0beta Now uses Mozilla NSS libs the RSA encryption.
             Added a windowed nonce to each message to avoid a replay attack.
             Trimmed message header/footer.
             Base64 instead of Base16 encoding of keys and messages. 

     1.20   Bugfix for key file reading
            Updated to new Gaim debug logging

     1.19   Gaim 0.63 compatible release: new plugin API in Gaim.
            Only sends notification message once per conversation now.
            Defaults to displaying incoming key and asking if user
              wants to accept it.
            Displays keys using a hash (aka fingerprint) rather than
              displaying high bytes of key.

     1.18   Gaim 0.61 compatible release.

     1.17   Gaim 0.60 compatible release.

     1.16   Fixed bug that could allow remote user to crash Gaim, or
            worse.

     1.14   Stuff added to config dialog.  Now does broadcast/
            detection of other Gaim-Encryption plugin users.
            Fixed problem with tabbed windows.
                                                           
     1.13   Now has config dialog, and prompts for key saving.  Oh,
            and it's saving keys in files! (ok, that went in between
            1.11 and 1.12)

     1.12   Now uses OpenSSL crypto libraries.

     1.11   Gaim-0.54 changed the interface to serv_send_im, breaking  
            1.10.  Also, gcc2.95.3 doesn't like unnamed unions, while  
            gcc2.96.x don't mind them.  Now works with either.         
                                                                       
     1.10:  Refactored some, and moved all the RSA specific code into  
            rsa.c.  Now should be much easier to add other types of    
            encryption routines, basically as sub-plugins.             
            This did break compatibility with the 1.0x releases though 
                                                                       
     1.01:  Fixed bug that resulted in dropping the "Encrypted" button 
            (with resulting crash).  Also set up to use a new (?)      
            interface function so that we encrypt after everything     
            else happens (now works with spellcheck!) and the sent     
            text gets erased again.  Tested with gaim-20020205

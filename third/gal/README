GNOME Application Libs (GAL).

This module contains some library functions that came from Gnumeric and
Evolution.  The idea is to reuse the code across various larger GNOME
applications that might want to use it.  The API is not frozen and might change
at any time.  Larger class renaming might happen at any point without notice.
Use this library at your own risk.

If you want to contribute code to Gal, you need to contact the maintainers of
this module as with any other module in GNOME, as the maintainers are the
people which will have to deal with bug reports, compilation problems,
portability issues and quality assurance.

All contributed code must be licensed as GNU LGPL.

Thanks to all the people who have worked on gal so far and who have
contributed code.  See the ChangeLogs for detailed lists of
contributions and changes.

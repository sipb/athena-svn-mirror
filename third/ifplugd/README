Overview

   ifplugd is a Linux daemon which will automatically configure your
   ethernet device when a cable is plugged in and automatically
   unconfigure it if the cable is pulled. This is useful on laptops with
   onboard network adapters, since it will only configure the interface
   when a cable is really connected.

   ifplugd ifplugd interfaces with your distribution's native network
   configuration utilities.

   Some features:
     * Uses your distribution's native ifup/ifdown programs.
     * May beep when the cable is unplugged, plugged, the interface
       configuration succeeded or failed.
     * Supports the Linux SIOCETHTOOL (newer, aka ethtool API),
       SIOCGMIIREG (older, aka mii-diag/mii-tool API) and SIOCDEVPRIVATE
       (oldest, aka mii-tool API) ioctl()s for getting link status.
     * Syslog support
     * Small program - the binary is just 19 KB (plus 11 KB for
       libdaemon).
     * Multiple ethernet interface support
     * Can be configured to ignore short "unplugged" periods (-d option)
       or short "plugged" periods(-u option)
     * Support for wireless networking. Whenever an association to an AP
       is detected the network is configured. Have a look on [24]waproamd
       if you need a facility to configure WEP keys before AP
       associations succeed.
     * Compatibility mode for network devices which do not support cable
       detection (-F option)

Status

   Version 0.23 is stable and has all the sensible features its users
   could think of.

Documentation

   Have a look on the man pages [25]ifplugd(8), [26]ifplugstatus(8),
   [27]ifplugd.conf(5). (An XSLT capable browser is required)

  Configuration

   Edit /etc/ifplugd/ifplugd.conf for configuration changes. This file is
   a bourne shell script sourced by the init script and used to start
   ifplugd with appropriate arguments. You may specify more than one
   ethernet interface in INTERFACES. For each interface a seperate
   instance of ifplugd is spawned. The arguments specified in ARGS are
   append to ifplugd's command line. Have a look on ifplugd -h or man
   ifplugd for further information about the available options.

   The network interface which is controlled by ifplugd should not be
   configured automatically by your distribution's network subsystem,
   since ifplugd will do this for you if needed.

   On Debian systems, any interfaces named in ifplugd's INTERFACES
   environment variable should not also be listed in an "auto" stanza in
   /etc/network/interfaces.

  Troubleshooting

   When you are using the hotplug subsystem (Debian package hotplug) you
   may notice that the network device is configured even when it is not
   listed on an auto line in /etc/network/interface. This may be due to
   hotplug being configured to ifup the network interface when it becomes
   available. This was the default behavior in the Debian hotplug package
   prior to release 0.0.20030117-1, for example. To prevent this you
   should either upgrade your hotplug package or comment out the ifup
   call in /etc/hotplug/net.agent.

   When using ifplugd together with APM (and probably ACPI) suspends,
   strange things may happen: some network devices fail to detect the
   network cable for a short period of time before and after the suspend.
   When using the -f switch, this will be treated as "no link beat", thus
   the network is shutdown after a timeout. During this timeout the
   machine changes to suspended state. When it is resumed again, the
   timeout period will have expired and so the network is deconfigured,
   however, as the next cable detection succeeds, the network is
   configured again immediately. To fix this problem, ifplugd should be
   disabled before the APM suspend and enabled back after the suspend.
   This may be done by using apmd and adding a script to
   /etc/apm/{suspend,resume}.d which simply calls /etc/init.d/ifplugd
   suspend, resp. /etc/init.d/ifplugd resume. It might even be a good
   idea to shut down the network completely during suspend, this may be
   achieved by calling /etc/init.d/ifplugd stop and /etc/init.d/ifplugd
   start in the appropriate places. I strongly urge the packagers of this
   software for the Linux distributions to add such scripts to their
   packages.

  FAQ

    1. Q: I want to use ifplugd with my PCMCIA device, but ifplugd quits
       when it doesn't find eth0, when I have not inserted the card. What
       can I do?
       A: Use the -f switch. This is not very clean however, since
       modprobe is called on each cable detection query of ifplugd to
       load a module for the network device. This is suboptimal. You
       should probably run ifplugd only when the card is really inserted.
    2. Q: I am using the -f switch, but the kernel logs are getting
       filled with messages like "modprobe: modprobe: Can't locate module
       eth0". What can I do?
       A: Make sure you have a line like alias eth0 off in your
       /etc/modules.conf
    3. Q: When the cable is unplugged and the interface shut down it is
       still available with ifconfig and markes as UP. Why this?
       A: ifplugd cannot detect the link beat with a shut down interface
       on certain (most as of kernel 2.4.19) network drivers. Thus
       ifplugd enables the interface before querying the link status.
       This may be switched off with -a flag. You might want to use it if
       you have a sane network driver (e.g. eepro100). The subdirectory
       patches/ in the ifplugd distribution includes a patch for the
       8139too 0.9.26 driver, which makes the driver compatible with -a.
       Don't ask me how to apply this patch. If you don't know, you won't
       need it.
    4. Q: Does it work with anything else than plain ethernet or wireless
       LAN?
       A: Certainly not, since the MII and ETHTOOL ioctl()s and the
       wireless extension don't exist on other network device types.
    5. Q: I have a Realtek 8139 based network card. Everytime ifplugd
       starts on bootup my machine freezes. What can I do?
       A: This is a bug in the 8139too driver 0.9.25 (at least) shipped
       with Linux 2.4.19, please upgrade to 8139too 0.9.26 (Linux 2.4.20
       or seperately at
       [28]http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/gkernel/).
    6. Q: There are already laptop-net's ifd and miid, why did you write
       your own daemon?
       A: laptop-net was too integrated with its profile system and
       didn't work on my hardware when I had a look on it. It seemed
       easier to me to write a simple but feature complete replacement
       than using laptop-net without most of the special features
       disabled. I didn't know about miid when I wrote ifplugd, but in
       any case ifplugd is much better than miid. For a comparison of
       miid and ifplugd, have a look on
       [29]http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=162763&repeat
       merged=yes

Requirements

   A newer Linux Kernel (I think 2.2 is good enough, alltough I tested it
   only with 2.4) with a compatible device driver and ethernet card. Most
   modern cards and drivers are compatible, like mine which works with
   the 8139too driver.

   ifplugd was developed and tested on Debian GNU/Linux "testing" from
   July 2003, it should work on most other Linux distributions (and maybe
   Unix versions) since it uses GNU autoconf and GNU libtool for source
   code configuration and shared library management.

   The machine used was a Medion 9580-F laptop with a Realtek 8139
   network card and a PRISM1 PCMCIA wireless LAN card.

   ifplugd needs [30]libdaemon.

Installation

   As this package is made with the GNU autotools you should run
   ./configure inside the distribution directory for configuring the
   source tree. After that you should run make for compilation and make
   install (as root) for installation of ifplugd.

   The installation scripts create an init script in
   ${sysconfdir}/init.d/ifplugd, however no /etc/rc?.d/ links are created
   for it.

   Extensive installation instructions for ifplugd are available at
   [31]Geoff Ericksson's web site.

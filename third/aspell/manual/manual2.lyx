Introduction
\layout Standard

GNU Aspell is a spell checker designed to eventually replace Ispell.
 It can either be used as a library or as an independent spell checker.
 Its main feature is that it does a much better job of coming up with possible
 suggestions than just about any other spell checker out there for the English
 language, including Ispell and Microsoft Word.
 It also has many other technical enhancements over Ispell such as using
 shared memory for dictionaries and intelligently handling personal dictionaries
 when more than one Aspell process is open at once.

\layout Subsection

Comparison to Ispell
\layout Subsubsection

Features that only Aspell has
\layout Itemize

Does a much better job with coming up with suggestions than Ispell does
 or for that matter any other spell checker I have seen.
 If you know a spell checker that does a better job please let me know.
\layout Itemize

Can learn from users misspellings.
\layout Itemize

Is an actual library that others programs can link to instead of having
 to use it through a pipe.
\layout Itemize

Is multiprocess intelligent.
 When a personal dictionary (or replacement list) is saved it will now first
 update the list against the dictionary on disk in case another process
 modified it.
\layout Itemize

Can share the memory used in the main word list between processes.
\layout Itemize

Support for detachable dictionaries
\series bold 
 
\series default 
so that more than one aspell class can use the same dictionary.
\layout Itemize

Support for multiple personal dictionaries as well as support for special
 auxiliary dictionaries.
\layout Itemize

Better support for run-together words.
\layout Itemize

Ability to use multiple dictionaries by simply specifying it on the command
 line or in the configuration files.
\layout Itemize

A better, more complete word list for the English language.
 Word lists are provided for American, British, and Canadian spelling.
 Special care has been taken to only include one spelling for each word
 in any particular word list.
 The word list included in Ispell by contrast only included support for
 American and British and also tends to included multiple spellings for
 a word which can mask some spelling errors.
\layout Subsubsection

Things that, currently, only Ispell have
\layout Itemize

Support for affix compression (However this should change soon once Kevin
 Hendricks is integrated)
\layout Itemize

Lower memory footprint
\layout Itemize

Perhaps better support for spell checking (La)TeX files.
\layout Itemize

Support for spell checking Nroff files.
\layout Chapter

Getting Started
\layout Section

Requirements
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{reqs}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

Aspell requires gcc 2.95 (or better) as the C++ compiler.
 Other C++ compilers should work with some effort.
 Other C++ compilers for mostly POSIX compliant (Unix, Linux, BeOS, CygWin)
 systems should work with out any major problems provided that the compile
 can handle all of the advanced C++ features Aspell uses.
 C++ compilers for non-Unix systems might work but it will take some work.
 Aspell at very least requires a Unix-like environment (sh, grep, sed, tr,
 etc...) in order to build.
 Aspell also uses a few POSIX functions when necessary.
\layout Section

Obtaining
\layout Standard

The latest version can always be found at GNU Aspell's home page at 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url{http://aspell.net}

\end_inset 

.
\layout Section

Support
\layout Standard

Support for Aspell can be found on the Aspell mailing lists.
 Instructions for joining the various mailing lists (and an archive of them)
 can be found off the Aspell home page at 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url{http://aspell.net}

\end_inset 

.
\layout Section

Helping Out
\layout Standard

I have very little time to work on Aspell so I desperately need other people
 to help with the development of Aspell.
 There are a lot of things that need to be done before I consider Aspell
 complete.
 See section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{todo}

\end_inset 

 for a list of them.
 I would really appreciate some help with doing them.
 If you are interested in helping with one of them please let me know.
\layout Standard

I am also looking for someone to eventually take over the maintenance and
 development of Aspell.
 If you are interested please contact me directly.
\layout Section

Compiling & Installing
\layout Subsection

Generic Install Instructions
\layout Quote

./configure && make
\layout Standard

For additional configure options type ./configure --help.
 You can control what C++ compiler is used by setting the environmental
 variable CXX before running configure and you can control what flags are
 passed to the C++ compile via the environmental variable CXXFLAGS.
 Static libraries are disabled by default since static libraries will not
 work right due to the mixing of C and C++.
 When a C program links with the static libraries in Aspell it is likely
 to crash because Aspell's C++ objects are not getting initialized correctly.
 However, if for some reason you want them, you can enable them via --enable-sta
tic.
\layout Standard

Aspell should then compile with out any additional user intervention.
 If you run into problems please first check the sections below as that
 might solve your problem.
\layout Standard

To install the program simply type
\layout Quote

make install
\layout Standard

After Aspell is installed at least one dictionary needs to be installed.
 You can find them at 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url{http://aspell.net/}

\end_inset 

.
 The "aspell" program must be in your path in order for the dictionaries
 to install correctly.
\layout Standard

If you do not have Ispell or the traditional Unix 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

spell
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 utility installed on your system than you should also copy the compatibly
 scripts 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

ispell
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

spell
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 located in the scripts/ directory into your binary directory which is usually
 /usr/local/bin so that programs that expect ispell or spell command will
 work correctly.
\layout Subsection

General Problems
\layout Standard

Aspell does not use a released version of GNU Libtool.
 If you have a need to modify configure.ac or any of the Makefile.am's you
 should install the CVS version of libtool.
\layout Subsection

Curses Notes
\layout Standard

If you are having problems compiling termios.cc than the most likely reason
 is due to incompatibilities with the curses implementation on your system.
 If this is the case than you can explicitly disable the curses library
 with --disable-curses.
 By doing this you will lose the nice full screen interface but hopefully
 you will be able to at least get Aspell to compile correctly.
\layout Standard

If the curses library is installed in a non-standard location than you can
 specify the library and include directory with --enable-curses=<<lib>>
 and --enable-curses-include=<<dir>>.
 
\series bold 
Lib
\series default 
 can either be the complete path of the library (for example 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

/usr/local/curses/libcurses.a
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

), the name of the library (for example 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

ncurses
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

) or a combined location and library in the form 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

-L<<lib dir>> -l<<lib>>
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 (for example 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

-L/usr/local/ncurses/lib -lncurses
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

).
 
\series bold 
Dir
\series default 
 is the location of the curses header files (for example 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

/usr/local/ncurses/include
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

).
 
\layout Subsection

Upgrading from Aspell .33/Pspell .12
\layout Standard

Aspell has undergone an extremely large number of changes since the previous
 Aspell/Pspell release.
 For one thing Pspell has been merged with Aspell so there in no longer
 two separate libraries you have to worry about.
\layout Standard

Because of the massive changes between Aspell/Pspell and Aspell 0.50 you
 may want to clean out the old files before installing the the new Aspell.
 To do so do a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

make uninstall
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 in the original Aspell and Pspell source directories.
\layout Standard

The way dictionaries are handled has also changed.
 This includes a change in the naming conventions of both language names
 and dictionaries.
 Due to the language name change, your old personal dictionaries will not
 be recognized.
 However, you can import the old dictionaries by running the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

aspell-import
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 script.
 This also means that dictionaries designed to work with older versions
 of Aspell are not likely to function correctly.
 Fortunately new dictionary packages are available for most languages.
 You can find them off of the Aspell home page at 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url{http://aspell.net}

\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

The Pspell ABI is now part of Aspell except that the name of everything
 has changed due to the renaming of Pspell to Aspell.
 In particular please note the following name changes:
\layout Quote

pspell -> aspell
\newline 
manager -> speller
\newline 
emulation -> enumeration
\newline 
master_word_list -> main_word_list
\layout Standard

Please also note that the name of the 
\series bold 
language-tag
\series default 
 option has changed to 
\series bold 
lang
\series default 
.
 However, for backward compatible the language-tag option will still work.
\layout Standard

However, you should also be able to build applications that require Pspell
 with the new Aspell as a backward compatibility header file is provided.
\layout Standard

Due to a change in the way dictionaries are handled, scanning for .pwli files
 in order to get find out which dictionaries are available will no longer
 work.
 This means that programs that relied on this technique may have problems
 finding dictionaries.
 Fortunately, GNU Aspell now provided a uniform way to list all installed
 dictionaries via the C API.
 See the file 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

list-dicts.c
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 in the examples/ directory for an example of how to due this.
 Unfortunately there is isn't any simply way to find out which dictionaries
 are installed which will work with both the old Aspell/Pspell and the new
 GNU Aspell.
\layout Subsection

Upgrading from a pre-release snapshot
\layout Standard

At the last minute I decided to merge the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

speller-util
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 program into the main 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

aspell
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 program.
 You may right to remove that speller-util program to avoid confusion.
 This also means that dictionaries designed to work with the snapshot will
 no longer work with the official release.
 
\layout Subsection

Win32 Notes
\layout Standard

Due to limited time and my general dislike for Microsoft Windows, Win32
 is not an officially supported platform for Aspell.
 However, it is possible for someone with experience with the Cgiwin development
 environment to create an Aspell binary and library (dll) using gcc as others
 have done so.
 The library, in theory, should be able to be used by any Win32 compiler
 if it is compiled right, but this theory has never been tested.
\layout Standard

Aspell requires Gcc 2.95 (or better) and the Cgiwin development environment
 in order to compile on Win32.
 Both the Cgiwin or the Mingw version of Gcc should work.
 The Mingw version of Aspell will have slightly less functionality, but
 none of which is noticeable to the end user.
 Microsoft Visual C++, however, will not work with the released version
 of Aspell as the compiler is far to buggy as far as C++ compliance goes.
 However, there is a patch available which should allow Aspell to compile
 using Microsoft Visual C++ which you can find at 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url{ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/aspell}

\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

In order to get the nice full screen interface with Mingw when spell checking
 files a curses implementation that does not require Cygwin is required.
 The PDCurses (
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url{http://www.lightlink.com/hessling/PDCurses/}

\end_inset 

) implementation is known to work, other implementations may work however
 they have not been tested.
 See the previous section for information on specifying the location of
 the curses library and include file.
\layout Standard

If Aspell is compiled with --enable-win32-relocatable and the 
\series bold 
bindir
\series default 
 is set to the same value as 
\series bold 
prefix
\series default 
 (ie not <<prefix>>/bin) then the Aspell directory (what prefix is set to)
 can be relocated anywhere provided that none of the data files are moved
 around within the Aspell directory.
 Please not that this feature has not been tested with GNU Aspell 0.50 so
 it may or may not work.
\layout Standard

The default paths for Aspell are designed for a Unix system and not a Win32
 system so you might want to specify different ones when compiling Aspell.
 Also if the HOME environmental variable is not set Aspell will assume it
 is the current working directly.
 This may lead to your personal word lists being saved in unpredictable
 locations.
 To solve this either compile with --enable-win32-relocatable (see above)
 or specify the complete path of the personal and replacement word lists
 in aspell.conf.
 If Aspell is compiled with --enable-win32-relocatable than the personal
 word lists are saved in the 
\series bold 
prefix
\series default 
 directory and the name is changed from 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
.aspell.<lang>.*
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 to
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 
\family typewriter 
<lang>.*
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

If you have experience with using Cgiwin or a Unix like environment and
 are willing to maintain an Aspell binary and/or library I would be willing
 to work with you to get Aspell to compile.
 If you are seriously interested please post to aspell-devel@gnu.org after
 you have given it an initial try.
 However, if, after reading this section, you do not know how to start then
 you most likely do not have the necessary experience to be able to get
 Aspell to compile.
 Please do not bother me with questions such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

I would like to use Aspell on Win32 but I have no idea what to do.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, as I am not willing to teach you the basics of working with a Unix like
 environment.
\layout Section

Using aspell-import
\layout Standard

The aspell-import Perl script will look for old personal dictionaries and
 will import them into GNU Aspell.
 It will look for both Ispell and Aspell ones.
 To use it just run it from the command prompt.
 If you get an error about /usr/bin/perl not being found than instead try
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

perl <<bindir>>/aspell-import
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 When running the script if you get a message like:
\layout LyX-Code

Error: No word lists can be found for the language "de".
\layout Standard

This means that you have not installed support for the given language, in
 this case 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

de
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 for German.
 To rectify the situation download and install a dictionary designed to
 work with GNU Aspell 0.50 or better.
\layout Chapter

Basic Usage
\layout Standard

For a quick reference on the Aspell utility use the command 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

aspell --help
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
\layout Section

Spellchecking Individual Files
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{check}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

To use Aspell to spellcheck a file use:
\layout Quote

aspell check [<<options>>] <<filename>>
\layout Standard

at the command line where <<filename>> is the file you want to check and
 <<options>> is any number of optional options.
 Some of the more useful ones include:
\layout Description

--mode=<<mode>> the mode to use when checking files.
 The available modes are none, url, email, sgml, or tex.
 See section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{filter}

\end_inset 

 for more informations on the various modes.
\layout Description

--dont-backup don't create a backup file.
\layout Description

--sug-mode=<<mode>> the suggestion mode to use where mode is one of ultra,
 fast, normal, or bad-spellers.
 See section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{suggestion}

\end_inset 

 for more information on these modes.
\layout Description

--master=<<name>> the main dictionary to use.
\layout Description

--keymapping=<<name>> the keymapping to use.
 Either 
\series bold 
aspell
\series default 
 for the default mapping or 
\series bold 
ispell
\series default 
 to use the same mapping that the ispell utility uses.
\layout Standard

Please see Chapter 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{customizing}

\end_inset 

 for more information on the available options.
\layout Standard

For example to check the file foo.txt:
\layout Quote

aspell check foo.txt
\layout Standard

and to check the file foo.txt using the bad-spellers suggestion mode and
 the large American English dictionary:
\layout Quote

aspell check --sug-mode=bad-spellers --master=american-lrg foo.txt
\layout Standard

If the 
\series bold 
mode
\series default 
 option is not given then aspell will use the extension of the file to determine
 the current mode.
 If the extension is .tex, then TeX mode will be uses, if the extension is
 .html, .htm, .php, or .sgml it will check the file in sgml mode, otherwise
 it will use url mode.
 These extensions can be changed via the 
\series bold 
tex-extension
\series default 
 and 
\series bold 
sgml-extension
\series default 
 options respectfully.
 See chapter 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{filter}

\end_inset 

 for more information on the various modes that can be used.
\layout Standard

If Aspell was compiled with curses support and the TERM environmental variable
 is set to a capable terminal type than Aspell will use a nice full screen
 interface.
 Otherwise it will use a simpler

Using Aspell with other Applications
\layout Subsection

With Applications that Expect Ispell
\layout Standard

Aspell can be used as a drop in replacement for Ispell for programs that
 use Ispell through a pipe such as Emacs and LyX.
 It can also be used with programs that use simple call the ispell command
 and expect the original file to be overwritten with the corrected version.
 It support the basic features of Ispell, however it does not currently
 have a Nroff mode so there may be situations in which you still wish to
 use Ispell.
 Nevertheless, I have been using Aspell for Xemacs and LyX since the middle
 of September of 1998 with out any problems.
\layout Standard

If you do not have Ispell installed on your system and have installed the
 Ispell compatibly script than you should not need to do anything as most
 applications will that expect Ispell will work as expected with Aspell
 via the Ispell compatibility script.
\layout Standard

Otherwise, the recommended way to use Aspell as a replacement for ispell
 is to change the Ispell command from within the program being used.
 If the program uses ispell in pipe mode simple change ispell to aspell.
 If the program calls the
\series bold 
 
\series default 
ispell command to check the file change 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

ispell
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 


\series bold 
 
\series default 
with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

aspell check
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

If that is impossible and the program uses ispell through a pipe than the
 run-with-aspell script can be used for programs using ispell in pipe mode.
 The format of the script is:
\layout Quote

run-with-aspell <<command>>
\layout Standard

where <<command>> is the name of the program with any optional arguments.
\layout Standard

The old method of mapping Ispell to Aspell is discouraged because it can
 create compatibility problems with programs that actually require Ispell
 such as Ispell's own scripts.
\layout Subsection

With Emacs and Xemacs
\layout Standard

The easiest way to use Aspell with Emacs or Xemacs is to add this line:
\layout LyX-Code

(setq-default ispell-program-name "aspell")
\layout Standard

to the end of your .emacs file.
\layout Standard

For some reason version 3.0 of ispell.el (the lisp program that (x)emacs uses)
 want to reverse the suggestion list.
 To fix this add this line:
\layout LyX-Code

(setq-default ispell-extra-args '("--reverse"))
\layout Standard

after the previous line in your .emacs file and it should solve the problem.
 
\layout Standard

Ispell.el, version 3.1 (December 1, 1998) and better, has the list reversing
 problem fixed.
 You can find it at 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url{http://www.kdstevens.com/~stevens/ispell-page.html}

\end_inset 

.
\layout Subsection

With LyX
\layout Standard

Version 1.0 of LyX provides support for Aspell learning for users mistake
 feature.
\layout Standard

To use aspell with LyX 1.0 either change the
\series bold 
 spell_command 
\series default 
option in the lyxrc file or use the run-with-aspell utility.
\layout Subsection

With VIM
\layout Standard


\shape italic 
(The following section was written by "R.
 Marc", rmarc at copacetic net.) 
\layout Standard

To use aspell in vim you simply need to add the following line to your .vimrc
 file:
\layout LyX-Code

map ^T :w!<CR>:!aspell check %<CR>:e! %<CR>
\layout Standard

I use <Ctrl-T> since that's the way you spell check in pico.
 In order to add a control character to your .vimrc you must type <Ctrl-v>
 first.
 In this case <Ctrl-v><Ctrl-t>.
\layout Standard

A more useful way to use Aspell, IMHO, is in combination with newsbody (
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url{http://www.image.dk/~byrial/newsbody/}

\end_inset 

) which is how I use it since vim is my editor for my mailer and my news
 reader.
\layout LyX-Code

map ^T 
\backslash 
1
\backslash 
2<CR>:e! %<CR>
\layout LyX-Code

map 
\backslash 
1 :w!<CR>
\layout LyX-Code

map 
\backslash 
2 :!newsbody -qs -n % -p aspell check 
\backslash 
%f<CR>
\layout Subsection

With Pine
\layout Standard

To use aspell in pine simply change the option 
\series bold 
speller
\series default 
 to 
\layout Quote

aspell --mode=email check
\layout Standard

To change the speller option go to the main menu.
 Type 
\series bold 
S
\series default 
 for 
\emph on 
setup
\emph default 
, 
\series bold 
C
\series default 
 for 
\emph on 
config
\emph default 
, then W for 
\emph on 
where is
\emph default 
.
 Type in 
\series bold 
speller
\series default 
 as the word to find.
 The speller option should be highlighted now.
 Hit enter, type in the above line, and hit enter again.
 Then type 
\series bold 
E
\series default 
 for
\emph on 
 exit setup
\emph default 
 and 
\series bold 
Y
\series default 
 to save the change.
\layout Standard

If you have a strong desire to check other peoples comments change 
\series bold 
speller
\series default 
 to
\layout Quote

aspell check
\layout Standard

instead which will avoid switching aspell into email mode.

Customizing Aspell
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{customizing}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The behavior of Aspell can be changed by any number of options which can
 be specified at either the command line, the environmental variable ASPELL_CONF
, a personal configuration file, or a global configuration file.
 Options specified on the command line override options specified by the
 environmental variable.
 Options specified by the environmental variable override options specified
 by either of the configurations files.
 Finally options specified by the personal configuration file override options
 specified in the global configuration file.
 Options specified in the environmental variable ASPELL_CONF, a personal
 configuration file, or a global configuration file will take effect no
 matter how Aspell is used which includes being used by other applications.
\layout Standard

Aspell has three basic type of options: 
\series bold 
boolean
\series default 
, 
\series bold 
value
\series default 
, and 
\series bold 
list
\series default 
.
 
\series bold 
Boolean
\series default 
 options are either enabled or disabled, 
\series bold 
value
\series default 
 options take a specific value, and 
\series bold 
list
\series default 
 options can either have entries added or removed from the list.
\layout Section

Specifying Options
\layout Subsection

At the Command Line
\layout Standard

All options specified at the command line have the following basic format:
\layout Quote

--<<option>>[=<<value>>]
\layout Standard

where the '=' can be replaced by whitespace.
\layout Standard

However some options also have single letter abbreviations of the form:
\layout Quote

-<<letter>>[<<optional whitespace>><<value>>]
\layout Subsubsection

Boolean
\layout Standard

To enable a boolean option simply special the option with out any corresponding
 value.
 For example to ignore accents when checking words use 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\end_inset 

.
 To disable a boolean option prefix the option name with a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

dont-
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 For example to not ignore accents when checking words use 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

--dont-ignore-accents
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

If a boolean option has a single letter abbreviation simply give the letter
 corresponding to either enabling or disabling the option with out any correspon
ding value.
 For example to consider run-together words legal use 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

-C
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\layout Subsection

Via a Configuration File
\layout Standard

Aspell can also accept options via a personal or global configuration file.
 The exact files to used are specified by the options 
\series bold 
per-conf
\series default 
 and 
\series bold 
conf
\series default 
 respectfully but the personal configuration file is normally 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

.aspell.conf
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 located in the HOME directory and the global one is normally 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

aspell.conf
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 which is located in the etc directory which is normally 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

/usr/etc
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

/usr/local/etc
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 To find out the particular values for your particular system use 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

aspell dump config
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

Each line of the configuration file has the format:
\layout LyX-Code

<<option>> [<<value>>]
\layout Standard

There may any number of spaces between the option and the value however
 it can only be spaces, ie there is no '=' between the option name and the
 value.
\layout Standard

Comments may also be included by preceding them with a '#' as anything from
 a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

#
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 to a newline is ignored.
 Blank lines are also allowed.
\layout Standard

Values set in the personal configuration file override those in the global
 file.
 Options specified at either the command line or via an environmental variable
 override those specified by either configuration file.
\layout Subsubsection

Boolean
\layout Standard

To specify a boolean option simply include the option followed by a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Notes on Various Filters and Filter Modes
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{filter}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

Aspell now has rudimentary filter support.
 You can either select from individual filters or chose a filter mode.
 To select a filter mode use the 
\series bold 
mode
\series default 
 option.
 You may chose from 
\series bold 
none
\series default 
, 
\series bold 
url
\series default 
, 
\series bold 
email
\series default 
, 
\series bold 
sgml
\series default 
, and
\series bold 
 tex
\series default 
.
 The default mode is 
\series bold 
url
\series default 
.
 Individual filters can be added with the option 
\series bold 
add-filter
\series default 
 and remove with the 
\series bold 
rem-filter
\series default 
 option.
 The currently available filters are 
\series bold 
url
\series default 
, 
\series bold 
email
\series default 
, 
\series bold 
sgml
\series default 
, 
\series bold 
tex
\series default 
 as well as a bunch of filters which translate the text from one format
 to another.
 
\layout Subsubsection

None Mode
\layout Standard

This mode is exactly what it says.
 It turns off all filters.
\layout Subsubsection

Url Filter/Mode
\layout Standard

The 
\series bold 
url
\series default 
 filter/mode skips over URL's, host names, and email addresses.
 Because this filter is almost always useful and rarely does any harm it
 is enabled in all modes except 
\series bold 
none
\series default 
.
 To turn it off either select the 
\series bold 
none
\series default 
 mode or use 
\series bold 
rem-filter
\series default 
 option 
\emph on 
after
\emph default 
 the desired mode is selected.
\layout Subsubsection

Email Filter/Mode
\layout Standard

The 
\series bold 
email
\series default 
 filter/mode skips over quoted text.
 It currently does not support skipping over headers however a future version
 should.
 In the mean time I suggest you use Aspell with Newsbody which can be found
 at

 controls the number of characters that can appear before the email quote
 char, the default is 10.
 The option 
\series bold 
add|rem-email-quote
\series default 
 controls the characters that are considered quote characters, the default
 is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

>' and '|'.
\layout Subsubsection

SGML Filter/Mode
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sgml}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The 
\series bold 
sgml
\series default 
 filter/mode will skip over sgml commands.
 It currently does not handle nested < > unless they are in quotes.
 It also does it handle the null end tag (net) minimization feature of sgml
 such as 
\layout Quote

<emphasis/important/
\layout Standard

This filter will also translate sgml characters of the form 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

&#num;
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 Other sgml characters such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

&amp;
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 will simply be skiped over so that the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

amp
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 for example will not be spell checked.
 Eventually full support for properly translating sgml characters will be
 added.
\layout Standard

The option 
\series bold 
add|rem-sgml-check
\series default 
 controls which sgml tags should always be checked.
 The default is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

alt
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

The option 
\series bold 
add|rem-sgml-extension
\series default 
 controls which file extensions are recognized as sgml/html files.
 The default is html, htm, php, and sgml.
 The extension are not case sensitive so extensions like .HTM will also be
 recognized.
\layout Subsubsection

TeX Filter/Mode
\layout Standard

The 
\series bold 
tex
\series default 
 (all lowercase) filter/mode skips over TeX commands and parameters and/or
 options to certain command.
 It also skips over TeX comments by default.
 The option 
\series bold 
[dont-]tex-check-comments
\series default 
 controls whether or not aspel will skip over TeX comments.
 The option
\series bold 
 add|rem-tex-command 
\series default 
controls which TeX commands should have certain parameters and/or options
 also skipped over.
 Commands that are not specified will have all there parameters and/or options
 checked.
 The format for each item is
\layout Quote

<<command>>\SpecialChar ~
\SpecialChar ~
<<a list of p,P,o and Os>>
\layout Standard

The first item is simple the command name.
 The second item controls which parameters to skip over.
 A 'p' skips over a parameter while a 'P' won't.
 Similar an 'o' will skip over an optional parameter while a 'O' won't.
 The first letter on the list will apply to the first parameter, the second
 letter will apply to the second parameter etc.
 If there are more parameters than letters Aspell will simply check them
 as normal.
 For example the option
\layout Quote

add-tex-command rule pp
\layout Standard

will skip over the first two parameters of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

rule
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 command while the option
\layout Quote

add-tex-command foo Pop
\layout Standard

will 
\emph on 
check
\emph default 
 the first parameter of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

foo
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 command, skip over the next optional parameter, if it is present, and will
 skip over the second parameter --- even if the optional parameter is not
 present --- and will check any additional parameters.
\layout Standard

A'*' at the end of the command is simply ignored.
 For example the option
\layout Quote

enlargethispage p
\layout Standard

will ignore the first parameter in both enlargethispage and enlargethispage*.
\layout Standard

To remove a command simple use the 
\series bold 
rem-tex-command
\series default 
 option.
 For example
\layout Quote

rem-tex-command foo
\layout Standard

will remove the command foo, if present, from the list of TeX commands.
\layout Subsection

Notes on the Prefix Option
\layout Standard

The 
\series bold 
prefix
\series default 
 option is there to allow Aspell to easily be relocated.
 Changing 
\series bold 
prefix
\series default 
 will change all directory names relative to the new prefix that are not
 explicitly set.
 For example if 
\series bold 
prefix
\series default 
 was 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

/usr/local/aspell
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 and 
\series bold 
dict-dir
\series default 
 has a default value of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

/usr/local/aspell/dict
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 than changing 
\series bold 
prefix
\series default 
 to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

/opt/aspell
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 will also change the default value of 
\series bold 
dict-dir
\series default 
 to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

/opt/aspell/dict
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 Note that modifying prefix will only effect the default compiled in values
 of directories.
 If a directory option is explicitly given a value than changing the value
 of 
\series bold 
prefix
\series default 
 has no effect on that directory option.
\layout Subsection

Notes on Typo-Analysis and the Keyboard Definition File
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{typo}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

Aspell .33 and better will, in general, give a higher priority to certain
 misspelling which are likely to be due to typos such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

teh
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 instead of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

the
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

hapoy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 instead of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

happy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 However in order to do this well Aspell needs to know the layout of the
 keyboard.
 The keyboard definition file simply identifies keys that are right next
 to each other.
 The file has an extension of .kbd and each line consists of two letters
 corresponding to two keys that are right next to each other.
 For example the line 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

as
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 will indicate that '
\family typewriter 
\series bold 
a
\family default 
\series default 
' and '
\family typewriter 
\series bold 
s
\family default 
\series default 
' are right next to each other.
 If 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

as
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 is listed as a entry it is not necessary to list 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

sa
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 as an entry as that will be done automatically.
 Also by 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

right next to each other
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 I mean to keys that are close enough together that it is easy to type one
 instead of the other.
 On most keyboards this means keys that are to the left or to the right
 of each other and not 
\emph on 
keys
\emph default 
 that are below or above it.
\layout Standard

The default for this option is normally 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

standard
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 However the default can be changed via the language data file.
 The normal default, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

standard
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, should work well for most QWERTY like keyboard layouts.
 It may need minor adjusting for foreign keyboards.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

dvorak
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 option can for a Dvorak layout.
 When creating a keyboard definition file for a foreign language please
 keep in mind that Aspell completely ignores accents when scoring words
 so that the key '
\family typewriter 
\series bold 
o
\family default 
\series default 
' and '
\family typewriter 
\series bold 
ö
\family default 
\series default 
' will appear to be the same key to aspell even if they are in fact separate
 keys on your keyboard.
\layout Subsection

Notes on the Different Suggestion Modes
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{suggestion}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

In order to understand what these suggestion modes do, a basic understanding
 of how aspell works is required.
 See section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{works}

\end_inset 

 for that.
 The suggestion modes are as follows.
\layout Description

ultra This method will use the fastest method available to come up with
 decent suggestions.
 This currently means that it will look for soundslikes within one edit
 distance apart without doing any typo analysis.
 It is slower than Ispell by a factor of 1.5 to 2 when a single word list
 is used.
 It speed is only minor affected by the size of the word list, if at all,
 but it is strongly effected by the number of word lists use.
 In this mode Aspell gets about 87% of the words from my small test kernel
 of misspelled words.
 (Go to 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url{http://aspell.net/test}

\end_inset 

 for more info on the test kernel as well as comparisons of this version
 of Aspell with previous versions and other spell checkers.)
\layout Description

fast This method is like ultra except that it also performs typo analysis
 unless it is turned off by setting the keyboard to none.
 The typo analysis brings words which are likely to be due to typos to the
 beginning of the list but slows things down by a factor of about two.
 This mode should get around the same number of words that the ultra method
 does.
\layout Description

normal This method looks for soundslikes within two edit distance apart
 and perform typo-analysis unless it is turned off.
 Is is around 10 times slower than fast mode with the english word list
 but returns better suggestions.
 Its speed is directly proportional to the size of the word list.
 This mode gets 93% of the words.
\layout Description

bad-spellers This method also looks for soundslikes within two edit distances
 apart but is more tailored for the bad speller where as fast or normal
 are more tailed to strike a good balance between typos and true misspellings.
 This mode never performs typo-analysis and returns a 
\emph on 
huge
\emph default 
 number of words for the really bad spellers who can't seam to get the spelling
 anything close to what it should be.
 If the misspelled word looks anything like the correct spelling it is bound
 to be found 
\emph on 
somewhere
\emph default 
 on the list of 100 or more suggestions.
 This mode gets 98% of the words.

Working With Dictionaries
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{manage}

\end_inset 


\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{dict-opts}

\end_inset 


\layout Section

How Aspell Selects an Appropriate Dictionary
\layout Standard

If the 
\series bold 
master
\series default 
 options is set in any fashion (via the command line, the ASPELL_CONF environmen
tal variable, or a configuration file) Aspell will look for a dictionary
 of that name.
 If one could not be found complain.
\layout Standard

Otherwise it will use the value of the 
\series bold 
lang
\series default 
 option to search for an appropriate dictionary.
 If more than one dictionary is found for the given language string than
 it will look for a dictionary with a matching jargon if the 
\series bold 
jargon
\series default 
 option is set.
 If it is not set it will look for a dictionary with no jargon.
 If after matching the lang and jargon there is still more than one dictionary
 available it will find one with the size closest to the value of the 
\series bold 
size
\series default 
 option.
 The default size is 60.
 If Aspell can not find a dictionary based on the 
\series bold 
lang
\series default 
 option than it will give up and complain.
\layout Standard

If the 
\series bold 
lang
\series default 
 option is not explicitly set its value will be based on the LC_MESSAGES
 locale.
 This locale is generally taken from the LC_MESSAGES environmental variable
 or the LANG environmental variable if LC_MESSAGES is not set.
 However, if Aspell is being used as a library from within another program
 which already explicitly set the locale then it will use the locale of
 the library rather than the environmental variables.
 If Aspell can not determine the language from the LC_MESSAGES locale than
 it will default to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

en_US
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
\layout Section

Listing Available Dictionaries
\layout Standard

For a list of available dictionaries use the command 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

aspell dump dicts
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 This will form a list of dictionaries that aspell will search when a dictionary
 is not specifically given.
\layout Section

Dumping the contents of the word list
\layout Standard

The dump command in 
\series bold 
aspell
\series default 
 will simply dump the contents of a word list to stdout in a format than
 can be read back in with 
\series bold 
aspell create
\series default 
.
\layout Standard

If no word list is specified the command will act on the default one.
 For example the command 
\layout Quote

aspell dump personal
\layout Standard

will simply dump the contents of the current personal word list to stdout.
\layout Section

Creating an Individual Word List
\layout Standard

To create an individual main word list from a list of words use the command
\layout Quote

aspell --lang=<<lang>> create master ./<<base>> < <<wordlist>>
\layout Standard

where <<base>> is the name of the word list and <<word list>> is the list
 of words separated by white space.
 The name of the word list will automatically be converted to all lowercase.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

./
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 is important because without it aspell will create the word list in the
 normal word list directory.
 If you are trying to create a word list in a language other than english
 check the aspell data-dir (usually /usr/share/aspell, use 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

aspell dump config
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 to find out what it is on your system) to see if a language data file exists
 for your language.
 If not you will need to create one.
 See chapter 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{inter}

\end_inset 

 for more information on using Aspell with other languages.
\layout Standard

This will create the file <<base>> in the current directory.
 To use the new word list copy the file to the normal word list directory
 (use 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

aspell config
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 to find out what it is) and use the option --master=<<base>>.
 
\layout Standard

The compiled dictionary file is machine dependent.
 It is dependent on endian order, and the page size for the machine because
 they are mmaped in.
 Please do not distribute the compiled dictionaries unless you are only
 distributing them for a particular platform such as you would a binary.
 That is why is normally installed in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

lib/aspell
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 instead of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

share/aspell
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

Aspell is now also able to use special 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

multi
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 dictionaries.
 See section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{dict-opts}

\end_inset 

 form more information.
\layout Standard

A personal and replacement word list can be created in a similar fashion.
\layout Standard

Because Aspell does not support any sort of affix compression like Ispell
 does Ispell word lists will not work as is.
 In order to use Ispell's word lists simply pipe the word list through ``ispell
 -e'' to expand the munched word lists.
\layout Subsection

Format of the Replacement Word List
\layout Standard

The replacement word has each replacement pair on its own line in the following
 format
\layout LyX-Code

<<misspelled word>> <<correction>>
\layout Section

Using Multi Dictionaries
\layout Standard

As with precious versions of aspell you can specify the main dictionary
 to use via the -d or --master option.
 However as of Aspell .32 you can now also:
\layout Enumerate

Specify more than word list to use with the 
\series bold 
extra-dicts
\series default 
 option.
\layout Enumerate

Optionally have all accents striped form the word lists using 
\series bold 
strip-accents
\series default 
 option.
 This is 
\emph on 
not
\emph default 
 the same thing as the 
\series bold 
ignore-accents
\series default 
 option.
 As enabling the 
\series bold 
ignore-accents
\series default 
 would accept both cafe and café (notice the accent on the e), but only
 enabling strip-accents would only accent cafe, even if café is in the original
 dictionary.
 Specify 
\series bold 
strip-accents
\series default 
 is just like using a word list with out the accents.
\layout Enumerate

Specify special 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

multi
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 dictionaries.
\layout Standard

A 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

multi
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 dictionary is a special file which basically a list of dictionary files
 to use.
 A multi dictionary must end is 
\series bold 
.multi
\series default 
 and has roughly the same format of a configuration file where the two valid
 keys are 
\series bold 
add 
\series default 
and 
\series bold 
strip-accents
\series default 
.
 The 
\series bold 
add
\series default 
 key is used for adding individual word lists, or other 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

multi
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 files.
 The 
\series bold 
strip-accents
\series default 
 key is used to control if accents are striped from the dictionaries.
 Unlike the global strip-accent option this option only effects word lists
 that came after the option.
 For example:
\layout Quote

strip-accents yes
\newline 
add english
\newline 
strip-accents no
\newline 
add must-accent
\layout Standard

will strip accents from the english word list but not the must-accent word
 list.
 If the global strip-accents option is specified the local strip-accents
 options are ignored
\layout LyX-Code

\layout Section

Dictionary Naming
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{dictname}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

In order for Aspell to be able to correctly recognize a dictionary based
 on the setting of the LANG environmental variable the dictionaries need
 to be located some where Aspell can find it and they need to be a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

multi
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 dictionary.
 Where aspell looks for dictionaries depends on the value of the 
\series bold 
dict-dir
\series default 
 and 
\series bold 
word-list-path
\series default 
 option.
 
\series bold 
Dict-dir
\series default 
 is generally <<prefix>>/lib/aspell, and 
\series bold 
word-list-path
\series default 
 is generally empty.
\layout Standard

Each dictionary that you expect aspell to be able to find needs to have
 the following name:
\layout Quote

<<language>>[_<<region>][-<<jargon>>][-<<size>>].multi
\layout Standard

Where <<language>> is the two letter language code, <<region>> is the two
 letter region code, <<jargon>> is any extra informations to distinguish
 the word list from other ones with the same language and spelling, and
 <<size>> is the size of the dictionary.
 If no size is specified that the default size of 60 will be assumed.
\layout Standard

For example:
\layout Quote

en.multi
\newline 
en_US.multi
\newline 
en-medical.multi
\newline 
en-medical-85.multi
\newline 
en-85.multi
\newline 
de.multi
\layout Section

AWLI files
\layout Standard

In order for Aspell to find dictionaries that are located in odd places
 or not named according to section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{dictname}

\end_inset 

 a AWLI file needs to be created for the dictionary and located in some
 place where Aspell can find it.
\layout Standard

Each AWLI has the the following name:
\layout Quote

<<language>>[_<<region>][-<<jargon>>][-<<size>>]-<<module>>.awli
\layout Standard

Where the names have the same meaning as in section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{dictname}

\end_inset 

 and <<module>> is the speller module to use, which should be set to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

default
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 for now since there is only one speller module.
\layout Standard

Each AWLI file for an Aspell word list should then contain exactly one line
 which contains the full path of the main word list.
\layout Chapter

Writing programs to use Aspell
\layout Standard

There are two main ways to use aspell from within your application.
 Through the external C API or though a pipe.
 The internal Aspell API can be used directly but that is not recommended
 as the actual Aspell API is constantly changing.
\layout Section

Though the C API
\layout Standard

The Aspell library contains two main classes and several helper classes.
 The two main classes are AspellConfig and AspellMaster.
 The AspellConfig class is used to set initial defaults and to change spell
 checker specific options.
 The AspellManager class does most of the real work.
 It is responsible for managing the dictionaries, checking if a word is
 in the dictionary, and coming up with suggestions among other things.
 There are many helper classes the important ones are AspellWordList, AspellMuta
bleWordList, Aspell*Enumeration.
 The AspellWordList classes is used for accessing the suggestion list, as
 well as the personal and suggestion word list currently in use.
 The AspellMutableWordList is used to manage the personal, and perhaps other,
 word lists.
 The Aspell*Enumeration classes are used for iterating through a list.
\layout Subsection

Usage
\layout Standard

To use Aspell your application should include 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

aspell.h
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 In order to insure that all the necessary libraries are linked in libtool
 should be used to perform the linking.
 When using libtool simply linking with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

-laspell
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 should be all that is necessary.
 When using shared libraries you might be able to simply link 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

-laspell
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, but this is not recommended.
 This version of Aspell uses the CVS version of libtool however released
 versions of libtool should also work.
\layout Standard

When your application first starts you should get a new configuration class
 with the command:
\layout LyX-Code

AspellConfig * spell_config = new_aspell_config();
\layout Standard

which will create a new AspellConfig class.
 It is allocated with new and it is your responsibility to delete it with
 delete_aspell_config.
 Once you have the config class you should set some variables.
 The most important one is the language variable.
 To do so use the command:
\layout LyX-Code

aspell_config_replace(spell_config, "lang", "en_US");
\layout Standard

which will set the default language to use to American English.
 The language is expected to be the standard two letter ISO 639 language
 code, with an optional two letter ISO 3166 country code after an underscore.
 You can set the preferred size via the 
\series bold 
size
\series default 
 option, any extra info via the 
\series bold 
jargon
\series default 
 option, and the encoding via the 
\series bold 
encoding
\series default 
 option.
 Other things you might want to set is the preferred spell checker to use,
 the search path for dictionary's, and the like see section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{options}

\end_inset 

 for a list of all available options.
\layout Standard

When ever a new document is created a new AspellManager class should also
 be created.
 There should be one speller class per document.
 To create a new speller class use the new_aspell_speller and then cast
 it up using to_aspell_speller like so.
\layout LyX-Code

AspellCanHaveError * possible_err = new_aspell_speller(spell_config);
\layout LyX-Code

AspellManager * spell_checker = 0;
\layout LyX-Code

if (aspell_error_number(possible_err) != 0)
\layout LyX-Code

  puts(aspell_error_message(possible_err));
\layout LyX-Code

else
\layout LyX-Code

  spell_checker = to_aspell_speller(possible_err);
\layout Standard

which will create a new AspellManager class using the defaults found in
 spell_config.
 To find out which dictionary is selected the 
\series bold 
lang
\series default 
, 
\series bold 
size
\series default 
, and 
\series bold 
jargon
\series default 
 options may be examinded.
 To find out the exact name of the dictionary the 
\series bold 
master
\series default 
 option way be examned as well as the 
\series bold 
master-flags
\series default 
 opntions to see if any special flags that were passed on to the module.
 The 
\series bold 
module
\series default 
 option way also be examed to figure out which speller module was selected,
 but since there is only one this option will always be the same.
\layout Standard

If for some reason you want to use different defaults simply clone spell_config
 and change the setting like so:
\layout LyX-Code

AspellConfig * spell_config2 = aspell_config_clone(spell_config);
\layout LyX-Code

aspell_config_replace(spell_config2, "lang","nl");
\layout LyX-Code

possible_err = new_aspell_speller(spell_config2);
\layout LyX-Code

delete_aspell_config(spell_config2);
\layout Standard

Once the speller class is created you can use the check method to see if
 a word in the document is correct like so:
\layout LyX-Code

int correct = aspell_speller_check(spell_checker, <word>, <size>);
\layout Standard

<word> can is expected to a const char * character string.
 If the encoding is set to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

machine unsigned 16
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

machine unsigned 32
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 <word> is expected to be a cast from either const u16int * or const u32int*
 respectfully.
 U16int and u32int are generally unsigned short and unsigned int respectfully.
 <size> is the length of the string or -1 if the sting is null terminated.
 If the string is a cast from const u16int * or const u32int * then size
 is the amount of space in bytes the string takes up after being casted
 to const char * and not the true size of the string.
 Aspell_speller_check will return 0 is it is not found and non-zero otherwise.
\layout Standard

If the word is not correct than the suggest method can be used to come up
 with likely replacements.
\layout LyX-Code

AspellWordList * suggestions = aspell_speller_suggest(spell_checker, <word>,
 <size>);
\layout LyX-Code

AspellStringEnumeration * elements = aspell_word_list_elements(suggestions);

delete_aspell_string_manag(elements);
\layout Standard

Notice how 
\family typewriter 
elements
\family default 
 is deleted but 
\family typewriter 
suggestions
\family default 
 is not.
 The value returned by suggestions is only valid to the next call to suggest.
 Once a replacement is made the store_repl method should be used to communicate
 the replacement pair back to the spell checker (see section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{replpair}

\end_inset 

 for why).
 It usage is as follows:
\layout LyX-Code

aspell_speller_store_repl(spell_checker, 
\layout LyX-Code

                          <misspelled word>, <size>,
\layout LyX-Code

                          <correctly spelled word>, <size>);
\layout Standard

If the user decided to add the word to the session or personal dictionary
 the the word can be be added using the add_to_session or add_to_personal
 methods respectfully like so:
\layout LyX-Code

aspell_speller_add_to_session|personal(spell_checker, <word>, <size>);
\layout Standard

It is better to let the spell checker manage these words rather than doing
 it your self so that the words have a change of appearing in the suggestion
 list.
\layout Standard

Finally, when the document is closed the AspellManager class should be deleted
 like so.
\layout LyX-Code

delete_aspell_speller(spell_checker);

API Reference
\layout Standard

Methods that return a boolean result generally return false on error and
 true other wise.
 To find out what went wrong use the error_number and error_message methods.
 Unless otherwise stated methods that return a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

const char *
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 will return null on error.
 In general, the charter string returned is only valid until the next method
 which returns a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

const char *
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 is called.
\layout Standard

For the details of the various classes please see the header files.

Notes About Thread Safety
\layout Standard

Read-only Aspell methods and functions should be thread safe as long as
 exceptions, new, delete, delete[], and STL allocators are thread safe.
 To the best of my knowledge gcc and egcs meet these requirements.
 It is up to the programmer to make sure multiple threads do not do thing
 such as change the dictionaries and add or delete items from the personal
 or session dictionaries.

Through A Pipe
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{pipe}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

When given the
\series bold 
 pipe
\series default 
 or 
\series bold 
-a
\series default 
 command aspell goes into a pipe mode that is compatible with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

ispell -a
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 Aspell also defines its own set of extensions to ispell pipe mode.
\layout Subsection

Format of the Data Stream
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{data_stream}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

In this mode, Aspell prints a one-line version identification message, and
 then begins reading lines of input.
 For each input line, a single line is written to the standard output for
 each word checked for spelling on the line.
 If the word was found in the main dictionary, or your personal dictionary,
 then the line contains only a '*'.
 
\layout Standard

If the word is not in the dictionary, but there are suggestions, then the
 line contains an '&', a space, the misspelled word, a space, the number
 of near misses, the number of characters between the beginning of the line
 and the beginning of the misspelled word, a colon, another space, and a
 list of the suggestions separated by commas and spaces.
\layout Standard

Finally, if the word does not appear in the dictionary, and there are no
 suggestions, then the line contains a '#', a space, the misspelled word,
 a space, and the character offset from the beginning of the line.
 Each sentence of text input is terminated with an additional blank line,
 indicating that ispell has completed processing the input line.
 
\layout Standard

These output lines can be summarized as follows: 
\layout Description

OK: * 
\layout Description

Suggestions: & <<original>> <<count>> <<offset>>: <<miss>>, <<miss>>, ...
 
\layout Description

None: # <<original>> <<offset>> 
\layout Standard

When in the -a mode, Aspell will also accept lines of single words prefixed
 with any of '*', '&', '@', '+', '-', '~', '#', '!', '%', or '^'.
 A line starting with '*' tells ispell to insert the word into the user's
 dictionary.
 A line starting with '&' tells ispell to insert an all-lowercase version
 of the word into the user's dictionary.
 A line starting with '@' causes ispell to accept this word in the future.
 A line starting with '+', followed immediately by a valid mode will cause
 aspell to parse future input according the syntax of that formatter.
 A line consisting solely of a '+' will place ispell in TeX/LaTeX mode (similar
 to the -t option) and '-' returns aspell to its default mode (but these
 commands are obsolete).
 A line '~', is ignored for ispell compatibility.
 A line prefixed with '#' will cause the personal dictionaries to be saved.
 A line prefixed with '!' will turn on terse mode (see below), and a line
 prefixed with '%' will return ispell to normal (non-terse) mode.
 Any input following the prefix characters '+', '-', '#', '!', '~', or '%'
 is ignored, as is any input following.
 To allow spell-checking of lines beginning with these characters, a line
 starting with '^' has that character removed before it is passed to the
 spell-checking code.
 It is recommended that programmatic interfaces prefix every data line with
 an uparrow to protect themselves against future changes in Aspell.
 
\layout Standard

To summarize these: 
\layout Description

*<<word>> Add a word to the personal dictionary 
\layout Description

&<<word>> Insert the all-lowercase version of the word in the personal dictionar
y
\layout Description

@<<word>> Accept the word, but leave it out of the dictionary
\layout Description

# Save the current personal dictionary
\layout Description

~ Ignored for ispell compatibility.
\layout Description

+ Enter TeX mode.
\layout Description

+<<mode>> Enter the mode specified by <<mode>>.
\layout Description

- Enter the default mode.
\layout Description

! Enter terse mode 
\layout Description

% Exit terse mode
\layout Description

^ Spell-check the rest of the line 
\layout Standard

In terse mode, Aspell will not print lines beginning with '*', which indicate
 correct words.
 This significantly improves running speed when the driving program is going
 to ignore correct words anyway.
\layout Standard

In addition to the above commands which are designed for Ispell compatibility
 Aspell also supports its own extension.
 All Aspell extensions follow the following format.
\layout Quote

$$<<command>> [data]
\layout Standard

Where data may or may not be required depending on the particular command.
 Aspell currently supports the following command.
\layout Description

cs\SpecialChar ~
<<option>>,<<value>> Change a configuration option.
\layout Description

cr\SpecialChar ~
<<option>> Prints the value of a configuration option.
\layout Description

pp Returns a list of all words in the current personal wordlist.
\layout Description

ps Returns a list of all words in the current session dictionary.
\layout Description

l Returns the current language name.
\layout Description

ra\SpecialChar ~
<<mis>>,<<cor>> Add the word pair to the replacement dictionary for latter
 use.
 Returns nothing.
\layout Standard

Anything returned is returned on its own line line.
 All lists returned have the following format
\layout Quote

<<num of items>>: <<item1>>, <<item2>>, <<etc>>

Notes of Storing Replacement Pairs
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{replpair}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The store_repl method and the $$ra should be used because Aspell is able
 to learn from users misspellings.
 For example on the first pass a user misspells beginning as beging so aspell
 suggests:
\layout Quote

begging, begin, being, Beijing, bagging, ....
\layout Standard

However the user then tries "begning" and aspell suggests
\layout Quote

beginning, beaning, begging, ...
 
\layout Standard

so the user selects beginning.
 However than, latter on in the document the user misspelles it as begng
 (NOT beging).
 Normally aspell will suggest.
\layout Quote

began, begging, begin, begun, ....
\layout Standard

However becuase it knows the user mispelled beginning as beging it will
 instead suggest:
\layout Quote

beginning, began, begging, begin, begun ...
\layout Standard

I myself often misspelled beginning (and still do) as something close to
 begging and two many times wind up writing sentences such as "begging with
 ....".
\layout Standard

Please also note that replacements commands has a memory.
 Which means if you first store the replacement pair:
\layout Quote

sicolagest -> psycolagest
\layout Standard

then store the replacement pair
\layout Quote

psycolagest -> psychologist
\layout Standard

The replacement pair
\layout Quote

sicolagest -> psychologist
\layout Standard

will also get stored so that you don't have to worry about it.

Adding Support For Other Languages
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{inter}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

Before you consider adding support for Aspell first make sure that someone
 else has not already done it.
 A good number of dictionaries off the Aspell home page at 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url{http://aspell.net}

\end_inset 

.
 If your language is not listed above please send me a note and I will work
 with you on adding support.
\layout Standard

This chapter describes the old manual way of adding support for a new language
 in Aspell.
 The recommended way to add support is through the aspell-dicts package.
 The scripts used, as well as some documentation on what to do, is available
 in the aspell-gen package which is available in the same location the dictionar
y packages are at.
\layout Standard

Adding a language to aspell is fairly straightforward.
 You need to create the language data file, and compile a new word list.
 
\layout Section

The Language Data File
\layout Standard

The basic format of the language data data is the same as it for aspell
 configuration file.
 It is named <<lang>>.dat and is located in the architecture independent
 data dir for aspell (option 
\series bold 
data-dir
\series default 
) which is usually <<prefix>>/share/aspell.
 Use 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

aspell config
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 to find out where it is in your installation.
 By convention the language name should be the two letter ISO 639 language
 code.
\layout Standard

The language data file has several mandatory fields, and several optional
 ones.
 All fields are case sensitive and should be in all lower case.
\layout Standard

The two mandatory fields are 
\series bold 
name
\series default 
 and 
\series bold 
charset
\series default 
.
 
\series bold 
Name
\series default 
 is the name of the language and should be the same as the file name (without
 the .dat).
 
\series bold 
Charset
\series default 
 is the charset aspell will expect the word lists to be formatted in.
 You may chose from any of the iso-8859-* character sets as well as, koi8-f,
 koi8-r, and viscii.
 If your language can fit in the plain old ASCII character set use iso8859-1.
 If you use some other character set for your language other than the ones
 listed here drop me a note and I will look into adding support for it.
\layout Standard

The optional fields are
\series bold 
 special, soundslike
\series default 
, 
\series bold 
keyboard
\series default 
 and a bunch of options to specify how run-together words are handles.
 
\series bold 
Special
\series default 
 is for non letter characters that can appear in your language such as the
 
\series bold 
'
\series default 
 and 
\series bold 
-
\series default 
.
 The format for the value is a list separated by spaces.
 Each item of the list has the following format
\layout Quote

<<char>>\SpecialChar ~
\SpecialChar ~
<<begin>><<middle>><<end>>
\layout Standard

<<char>> is the non letter character in question.
 <<begin>>,<<middle>>,<<end>> are either a '-' or a '*'.
 A star for <<begin>> means that the character at the beginning of the word,
 a '-' means it can't.
 The same is true for <<middle>> and <<end>>.
 For example the entry for the
\series bold 
 '
\series default 
 in english is:
\layout LyX-Code

' -*-
\layout Standard

To include more than one middle character just list them one after another
 on the same line.
 for example to make both the ' and the - a middle character use the following
 line in the language data file:
\layout LyX-Code

special ' -*- - -*-
\layout Standard

The 
\series bold 
soundslike 
\series default 
option,
\series bold 
 
\series default 
if present, should be the name of the soundslike data for the language.
 The data is expected to be in the file <<name>>_phonetic.dat.
 
\layout Standard

If the name is 
\series bold 
generic
\series default 
 a really generic soundslike algorithm will be used which consists of striping
 all the vowels and removing all accents.
 I recommend first using the generic algorithm and then, after aspell is
 working with the new language, work on the transformation array.
\layout Standard

If the soundslike name is 
\series bold 
none
\series default 
 then no soundslike lookup table will be used.
 This will reduce the size of the compiled word list by around 50% but at
 the sacrifice of suggestion quality.
 If the soundslike is none than the soundslike for the word will simply
 be the word itself in lowercase, will all accents stripped.
 For languages with phonetic spelling the difference will not be very noticeable.
 However, for languages with non-phonetic spelling there will be a noticeable
 difference.
 The difference you notice will depend on the quality of the soundslike
 data file.
 If you do not notice much of a difference for a language with non-phonetic
 spelling that is a good indication that the soundslike data is not rough
 enough---or the words you are trying are not that badly misspelled.
\layout Standard

The keyboard option specifies the base name of the keyboard definition file
 to use.
 See section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{typo}

\end_inset 

 for more information.
\layout Standard

The options to control how run-together words are handled are the same as
 the are in the normal configurations files.
 Please see section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{run-together}

\end_inset 

 for more information.
\layout Section

Compiling the Word List
\layout Standard

Once you have a working language data file installed in the right place
 you are ready to compile the main word list.
 See section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{manage}

\end_inset 

 to find out what to do.
 This section also includes instructions for creating the awli file.
\layout Section

Phonetic Code
\layout Standard


\shape italic 
(The following section was written by Björn Jacke, bjoern.jacke at gmx de)
\layout Standard

Aspell is in fact the spell checker that comes up with the best suggestions
 if it finds an unknown word.
 One reason is that it does not just compare the word with other words in
 the dictionary (like Ispell does) but also uses phonetic comparisons with
 other words.
\layout Standard

The new table driven phonetic code is very flexible and setting up phonetic
 transformation rules for other languages is not difficult but there can
 be a number of stumbling stones --- that's why I wrote this section.
\layout Standard

The main phonetic code is free of any language specific code and should
 be powerful enough to allow setting up rules for any language.
 Anything which is language specific is kept in a plain text file and can
 easily be edited.
 So it's even possible to write phonetic transformation rules if you don't
 have any programming skills.
 All you need to know is how words of the language are written and how they
 are pronounced.
\layout Subsection

Syntax of the transformation array
\layout Standard

In the translation array there are two strings on each line; the first one
 is the search string (or switch name) and the second one is the replacement
 string (or switch parameter).
 The line
\layout LyX-Code

version   <<version>>
\layout Standard

is also required to appear somewhere in the translation array.
 The version string can be anything but it should be changed when ever the
 a new version of the translation array is released.
 This is important because it will keep Aspell from using a compiled dictionary
 with the wrong set of rules.
 For example if when coming up with suggestion for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

hallo
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 aspell will use the new rules to come up with the soundslike say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

H*L*
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 but if hello is stored in the dictionary using the old rules as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

HL
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 instead of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

H*L*
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 aspell will never be able to come up with hello.
 So to solve this problem Aspell checks if the version strings match and
 abort with an error if they don't.
 Thus it is important to update it when ever a new version of the translation
 array is releases.
 This is only a problem with the main word list as the personal word lists
 are now stored as simple word lists with a single header line (ie, no soundslik
e data).
\layout Standard

Each non switch line represents one replacement (transformation) rule.
 Words beginning with the same letter must be grouped together; the order
 inside this group does not depend on alphabetical issues but it gives prioritie
s; the higher the rule the higher the priority.
 That's why the first rule that matches is applied.
 In the following example:
\layout LyX-Code

\layout LyX-Code

GH     _ 
\newline 
G      K 
\newline 
 
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

GH 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
nach 
\end_inset 

_
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 has higher priority than 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

G 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
nach 
\end_inset 

K
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

_
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 represents the empty string 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 If 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

GH 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
nach 
\end_inset 

_
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 would stand after 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

G 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
nach 
\end_inset 

K
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, the second rule would never match because the algorithm would stop searching
 for more rules after the first match.
 The above rules transform any 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

GH
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 to an empty string (delete them) and transform any other 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

G
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

K
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

At the end of the first string of a line (the search string) there may optionall
y stand a number of characters in brackets.
 One (only one!) of these characters must fit.
 It's comparable with the [ ] brackets in regular expressions.
 The rule 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

DG(EIY) 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
nach 
\end_inset 

J
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 for example would match any 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

DGE
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

DGI
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

DGY
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 and replace them with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

J
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 This way you can reduce several rules to one.
\layout Standard

Behind the search string there can stand one or more dashes (-).
 Those search strings will be matched totally but only the beginning of
 the string will be replaced.
 Furthermore for these rules no follow-up rule will be searched (what this
 is will be explained later).
 The rule 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

TCH-- 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
nach 
\end_inset 

_
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 will match any word containing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

TCH
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 (like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

match
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

) but will only replace the first character 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

T
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 with an empty string.
 The number of dashes determines how many characters from the end will not
 be replaced.
 After the replacement the search for transformation rules continues with
 the not replaced 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

CH
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

! 
\layout Standard

If a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

<
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 is appended to the search string, the search for replacement rules will
 continue with the replacement string and not with the next character of
 the word.
 The rule 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

PH< 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
nach 
\end_inset 

F
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 for example would replace 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

PH
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

F
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 and then again start to search for a replacement rule for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

F\SpecialChar \ldots{}

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 If there would also be rules like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

FO 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
nach 
\end_inset 

O
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

F 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
nach 
\end_inset 

_
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 then words like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

PHOXYZ
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 would be transformed to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

OXYZ
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 and any occurrences of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

PH
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 that are not followed by an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

O
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 will be deleted like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

PHIXYZ
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard
 
\backslash 
nach
\end_inset 

 IXYZ
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 The second replacement however is not applied if the priority of this rule
 is lower than the priority of the first rule.
\layout Standard

Priorities are added to a rule by putting a number between 0 and 9 at the
 end of the search string, for example 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

ING6 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
nach 
\end_inset 

N
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 The higher the number the higher is the priority.
\layout Standard

Priorities are especially important for the previously mentioned follow-up
 rules.
 Follow-up rules are searched beginning from the last string of the first
 search string.
 This is a bit complicated but I hope this example will make it more clear:
\layout LyX-Code

\layout LyX-Code

CHS      X
\newline 
CH       G
\newline 

\newline 
HAU--1   H
\newline 

\newline 
SCH      SH
\newline 
 
\layout Standard

In this example 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

CHS' in the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

FUCHS
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 would be transformed to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

X
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 If we take the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

DURCHSCHNITT
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 the things look a bit different.
 Here 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

CH
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 belongs together and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

SCH
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 belongs together and both are spoken separately.
 The algorithm however first finds the string 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

CHS
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 which may not be transformed like in the previous word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

FUCHS
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 At this point the algorithm can find a follow up rule.
 It takes the last character of the first matching rule (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

CHS
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

) which is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

S
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 and looks for the next match, beginning from this character.
 What it finds is clear: It finds 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

SCH 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
nach 
\end_inset 

SH
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, which has the same priority (no priority means standard priority, which
 is 5).
 If the priority is the same or higher the follow-up rule will be applied.
 Let's take a look at the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

SCHAUKEL
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 In this word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

SCH
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 belongs together and may not be torn apart.
 After the algorithm has found "SCH 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
nach 
\end_inset 

SH" it searches for a follow-up rule for "H"+"AUKEL".
 It finds "HAU--1 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
nach 
\end_inset 

H", but does not apply it because its priority is lower than the one of
 the first rule.
 You see that this is a very powerful feature but it also can easily lead
 to mistakes.
 If you really don't need this feature you can turn it off by putting the
 line
\layout LyX-Code

followup      0 
\layout Standard

at the beginning of the phonetic table file.
 As mentioned, for rules containing a `-' no follow-up rules are searched
 but giving such rules a priority is not totally senseless because they
 self can be follow-up rules and in that case the priority makes sense again.
 Follow-up rules of follow-up rules are not searched because this is in
 fact not needed very often.
\layout Standard

The control character "
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
hoch
\end_inset 

" says that the search string only matches at the beginning of words so
 that the rule "RH
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
hoch 
\backslash 
nach 
\end_inset 

R" will only apply to words like "RHESUS" but not "PERHAPS".
 You can append another "
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
hoch
\end_inset 

" to the search string.
 In that case the algorithm treats the rest of the word totally separately
 from first matched string in at beginning.
 This is useful for prefixes whose pronunciation does not depend on the
 rest of the word and vice versa like "OVER
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
hoch
\backslash 
hoch
\end_inset 

" in English for example.
\layout Standard

The same way as "
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
hoch
\end_inset 

" works does "$" only apply on words that end with the search string.
 "GN$
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard
 
\backslash 
nach 
\end_inset 

N" only matches on words like "SIGN" but not "SIGNUM".
 If you use "
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
hoch
\end_inset 

" and "$" together, both of them must fit "ENOUGH
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
hoch
\end_inset 

$ 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
nach 
\end_inset 

NF" will only match the word "ENOUGH" and nothing else.
\layout Standard

Of course you can combine all of the mentioned control characters but they
 must occur in this order: 
\family typewriter 
< - priority \i \^{}
 $
\family default 
.
 All characters must be written in CAPITAL letters.
\layout Standard

If absolutely no rule can be found --- might happen if you use strange character
s for which you don't have any replacement rule --- the next character will
 simply be skipped and the search for replacement rules will continue with
 the rest of the word.
\layout Standard

If you want double letters to be reduced to one you must set up a rule like
 "LL- 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
nach 
\end_inset 

L".
 If double letters in the resulting phonetic word should be allowed, you
 must place the line
\layout LyX-Code

collapse_result     0 
\layout Standard

at the beginning of your transformation table file; otherwise set the value
 to `1'.
 The English rules for example strip all vowels from words and so the word
 "GOGO" would be transformed to "K" and not to "KK" (as desired) if 
\family typewriter 
collapse_result
\family default 
 is set to 1.
 That's why the English rules have 
\family typewriter 
collapse_result
\family default 
 set to 
\family typewriter 
0
\family default 
.
\layout Subsection

How do I start finally?
\layout Standard

Before you start to write an array of transformation rules, you should be
 aware that you have to do some work to make sure that things you do will
 result in correct transformation rules.
\layout Subsubsection

Things that come in handy
\layout Standard

First of all you need to have a large word list of the language you want
 to make phonetics for.
 It should contain about as many words as the dictionary of the spell checker.
 If you don't have such a list, you will probably find an Ispell dictionary
 at 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url{http://fmg-www.cs.ucla.edu/geoff/ispell-dictionaries.html}

\end_inset 

 which will help you.
 You can then make affix expansion via 
\family typewriter 
ispell -e
\family default 
 and then pipe it trough 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
tr " " "
\backslash 
n"
\family default 
 to put one word on each line.
 After that you eventually have to convert special characters like `é' from
 Ispell's internal representation to latin1 encoding.
 
\family typewriter 
sed s/e'/é/g
\family default 
 for example would replace all e' with é.
\layout Standard

The second is that you know how to use regular expressions and know how
 to use 
\family typewriter 
grep
\family default 
.
 You should for example know that 
\layout LyX-Code

grep \i \^{}
[\i \^{}
aeiou]qu[io] wordlist | less
\layout Standard

will show you all words that begin with any character but a, e, i, o or
 u and then continue with `qui' or `quo'.
 This stuff is important for example to find out if a phonetic replacement
 rule you want to set up is valid for all words which match the expression
 you want to replace.
 Taking a look at the regex(7) man page is a good idea.
\layout Subsubsection

What the phonetic code should do
\layout Standard

Normal text comparison works well as long as the typer misspells a word
 because he pressed one key he didn't really want to press.
 In this cases mostly one character differs from the original word.
\layout Standard

In cases where the writer didn't know about the correct spelling of the
 word however the word may have several characters that differ from the
 original word but usually the word would still sound like the original
 word.
 Someone might think for example that `tough' is spelled `taff'.
 No spell checker without phonetic code will come to the idea that this
 might be `tough' but a spell checker who knows that `taff' would be pronounced
 like `tough' will make good suggestions to the user.
 Another example could be `funetik' and `phonetic'.
\layout Standard

From this examples you can see that the phonetic transformation should not
 be too fussy and too precise.
 If you implement a whole phonetic dictionary as you can find it in books
 this will not be very useful because then there could still be many characters
 differing from the misspelled and the desired word.
 What you should do if you implement the phonetic transformation table is
 to reduce the number of used letters to the only really necessary ones.
\layout Standard

Characters that sound similar should be reduced to one.
 In English language for example `Z' sounds like `S' and that's why the
 transformation rule 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Z 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
nach 
\end_inset 

S
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 is present in the replacement table.
 `PH' is spoken like `F' and so we have a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

PH 
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
nach 
\end_inset 

F
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 rule.
\layout Standard

If you take a closer look you will even see that vowels sound very similar
 in English language: `contradiction', `cuntradiction', `cantradiction'
 or `centradiction' in fact sound nearly the same, don't they? Therefore
 the English phonetic replacement rules not only reduce all vowels to one
 but even remove them all (removing is done by just setting up no rule for
 those letters).
 The phonetic code of `contradiction' is `KNTRTKXN' and if you try to read
 this letter-monster loud you will hear that it still sound a bit like `contradi
ction'.
 You also see that `D' is transformed to `T' because they nearly sound the
 same.
\layout Standard

If you think you have found a regularity you should 
\emph on 
always
\emph default 
 take your word list and grep for the corresponding regular expression you
 want to make a transformation rule for.
 An example: If you come to the idea that all English words ending on `ough'
 sound like `AF' at the end because you think of `enough' and `tough'.
 If you then grep for the corresponding regular expression by 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

grep -i ough$ wordlist
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 you will see that the rule you wanted to set up is not correct because
 the rule doesn't fit to words like `although' or `bough'.
 So you have to define your rule more precisely or you have to set up exceptions
 if the number of words that differ from the desired rule is not so big.
\layout Standard

Don't forget about follow-up rules which can help in many cases but which
 also can lead to many confusions and side effects.
 It's also important to write exceptions in front of the more general rules
 ("GH" before "G" etc.).
\layout Standard

If you think you have set up a number of rules that may produce some good
 results try them out! If you run Aspell as
\family typewriter 
 
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

aspell --lang=<<your language>> pipe
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 you get a prompt at which you can type in words.
 If you just type words Aspell checks them and eventually makes suggestions
 if they are misspelled.
 If you type in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

$$Sw <<word>>
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 you will see the phonetic transformation and you can test out if your work
 does what you want.
 
\layout Standard

Another good way to control if changes you apply to your rules don't have
 any evil side effects is to create another list from your word list which
 contains not only the word of the word list but also the corresponding
 phonetic version of this word on the same line.
 If you do this one time before the change and one time after the change
 you can make a diff (see 
\family typewriter 
man diff
\family default 
) to see what 
\emph on 
really
\emph default 
 changed.
 To do this use the command 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

aspell --lang=<<your language>> soundslike
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 In this mode aspell will output the the original word and then its soundslike
 separated by a tab character for each word you give it.
 If you are interested in seeing how the algorithm works you can download
 a set of useful programs from 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url{http://members.xoom.com/maccy/spell/phonet-utils.tar.gz}

\end_inset 

.
 This includes a program that produces a list as mentioned above and another
 program which illustrates how the algorithm works.
 It uses the same transformation table as Aspell and so it helps a lot during
 the process of creating a phonetic transformation table for Aspell.
\layout Standard

During your work you should write down your basic ideas so that other people
 are able to understand what you did (and you still know about it after
 a few weeks).
 The English table has a huge documentation appended for example.
\layout Standard

Now you can start experimenting with all the things you just read and perhaps
 set up a nice phonetic transformation table for your language to help Aspell
 to come up with the best correction suggestions ever seen also for your
 language.
 Take a look at the Aspell homepage to see if there is already a transformation
 table for your language.
 If there is one you might also take a look at it to see if it could be
 improved.

Controlling the Behavior of Run-together Words
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{run-together}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

Aspell has support for either unconditionally accepting run-together words
 or only accepting certain words in compound formation.
\layout Standard

Support for unconditionally accepting run-together words can either be turned
 on in the language data file or as a normal option via the 
\series bold 
run-together
\series default 
 option.
 The 
\series bold 
run-together-limit
\series default 
 options controls the maximum number of words that can be strung together,
 the default is normally 255.
 The 
\series bold 
run-together-min
\series default 
 options controls the minimal length the individual components of the run
 together word can be, the default is normally 3.
 Both the run-together-limit and run-together-min option may be specified
 in both the language data file or as a normal.
 The 
\series bold 
run-together-mid
\series default 
 option, which may only be specified in the language data file, may be used
 to specify up to three optional characters that may appear between individual
 words.
\layout Standard

In order for aspell to conditionally only accept certain words in compounds
 those words must be flagged when the compiled word list is being created.
 The format for each entry is
\layout Quote

<<word>>:C[1][2][3]<<middle char>>
\layout Standard

The 1, 2, and 3 control if the word is allowed to appear in the begging,
 middle, or end of the compound, respectfully.
 More than one position flag may be specified.
 If none of them are specified it as assumed that the word may appear anywhere.
 The C is optional if 1, 2, or 3 is specified.
 The <<middle char>> represents an optional character that may appear after
 the word in the formation of the compound if the word is not at the end
 of the compound.
 If the letter is lowercase than the character may appear after the word,
 if it is in uppercase then that letter must appear after the compound.
 Only one letter may be specified and it must also be in the list of middle
 letters specified via the 
\series bold 
run-together-mid 
\series default 
option.

\series bold 
 
\series default 
The 
\series bold 
run-together-limit 
\series default 
option may also be used to specify the maximum number of words to string
 together.
 
\layout Standard

For example the word list:
\layout Quote

beg:1
\newline 
mid:2 
\newline 
end:3 
\newline 
any:C 
\newline 
never 
\newline 
must:CM 
\newline 
maybe:Cm
\layout Standard

Means that the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

beg
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 may only appear at the begging of a word, the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

mid
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 at the middle, the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

end
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 at the end, and the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

any
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 any place.
 The word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

never
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 is never accepted in a compound unless the 
\series bold 
run-together
\series default 
 option is set.
 The word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

must
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 may appear anywhere however it must be followed by an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

m
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, while the word maybe may be followed by an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

m
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 Given the above word list the following compounds or legal:
\layout Quote

begmidend
\newline 
begany
\newline 
mustmend 
\newline 
maybeend 
\newline 
maybemend
\layout Standard

are all legal, but the following are not:
\layout Quote

begmid
\newline 
mustend
\newline 
neverany
\layout Standard

Individual words such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

beg
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 are always accepted.
\layout Standard

When the 
\series bold 
run-together
\series default 
 option is not set Aspell will only accept words that have been flagged
 in a run-together word.
 When the 
\series bold 
run-together
\series default 
 option is set aspell will accept words which are as least as long as the
 value specified in the 
\series bold 
run-together-min
\series default 
 option.
 If the words length is less than 
\series bold 
run-together-min
\series default 
 then it will only accept the word if it has been flagged.
 When the 
\series bold 
run-together
\series default 
 option is not set the 
\series bold 
run-together-min
\series default 
 option is ignored all together.
\layout Standard

Currently Aspell only supports run-together words when checking if a word
 is in the dictionary.
 When coming up with suggestions Aspell treats the word as a normal word
 and does not do anything special.
 This means that the suggestions will be virtually meaningless when the
 actual word is a run-together.
 I plan on more intelligently supporting run-together words when coming
 up with suggestions in a future version of Aspell.

How Aspell Works
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{works}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The magic behind my spell checker comes from merging Lawrence Philips excellent
 metaphone algorithm and Ispell's near miss strategy which is inserting
 a space or hyphen, interchanging two adjacent letters, changing one letter,
 deleting a letter, or adding a letter.
\layout Standard

The process goes something like this.
\layout Enumerate

Convert the misspelled word to its soundslike equivalent (its metaphone
 for English words).
\layout Enumerate

Find all words that have a soundslike within one or two edit distances from
 the original words soundslike.
 The edit distance is the total number of deletions, insertions, exchanges,
 or adjacent swaps needed to make one string equivalent to the other.
 When set to only look for soundslikes within one edit distance it tries
 all possible soundslike combinations and check if each one is in the dictionary.
 When set to find all soundslike within two edit distance it scans through
 the entire dictionary and quickly scores each soundslike.
 The scoring is quick because it will give up if the two soundslikes are
 more than two edit distances apart.
\layout Enumerate

Find misspelled words that have a correctly spelled replacement by the same
 criteria of step number 2 and 3.
 That is the misspelled word in the word pair (such as teh -> the) would
 appear in the suggestions list as if it was a correct spelling.
\layout Enumerate

Score the result list and return the words with the lowest score.
 The score is roughly the weighed average of the weighed edit distance of
 the word to the misspelled word and the soundslike equivalent of the two
 words.
 The weighted edit distance is like the edit distance except that the various
 edits have weights attached to them.
\layout Enumerate

Replace the misspelled words that have correctly spelled replacements with
 their replacements and remove any duplicates that might arise because of
 this.
\layout Standard

Please note that the soundslike equivalent is a rough approximation of how
 the words sounds.
 It is not the phoneme of the word by any means.
 For more details about exactly how each step is performed please see the
 file

\layout Section

Things that need to be done
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{todo}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

These items need to be done before I consider Aspell finished.
 Unfortunately, I do not have the time to do all so if you are interested
 in helping me with one of these tasks please email me.
 Good C++ skills are needed for most of these tasks involving coding.
\layout Itemize

Convert manual from LyX/LaTeX to Texinfo.
\layout Itemize

Clean up copyright notices and bring the Aspell package up to GNU Standards.
\layout Itemize

Add gettext support to Aspell.
\layout Itemize

Allow Aspell to check documents which are in UTF-8.
 The main thing to be done is to get Aspell to display UTF-8 correctly.
 This will involve being able to get the length of UTF-8 strings and display
 UTF-8 using the curses library.
\layout Itemize

Make Aspell Thread safe.
 Even though Aspell itself is not multi-threaded I would like it to be thread
 safe so that it can be used by multi-threaded programs.
 There are several areas of Aspell that that are potently thread unsafe
 (such as accessing a global pool) and several several classes which have
 the potential of being used by more than one thread (such as the personal
 dictionary).
\layout Itemize

Allow filters to be loaded at run-time.
 At the moment all filters must be complied in.
\layout Itemize

Integrate Kevin Hendricks affix compression code into Aspell.
 His code is already in use in OpenOffice as part of the lingucomponent
 component.
 More information can be found at 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url{http://whiteboard.openoffice.org/lingucomponent/dictionary.html}

\end_inset 

.
 The latest version of his code is also available there.
\layout Itemize

Create a C++ interface for Aspell, possibly on top of the C one.
\layout Itemize

Enhance ispell.el so that it will work better with the new Aspell.
\layout Section

Good ideas that are worth implementing
\layout Standard

These items all sound like good ideas however I am not sure when I will

The following good ideas where found in the ispell WISHES file so I thought
 I would pass them on.
\layout Itemize

Ispell should be smart enough to ignore hyphenation signs, such as the TeX
 
\backslash 
- hyphenation indicator.
\layout Itemize

(Jeff Edmonds) The personal dictionary should be able to remove certain
 words from the master dictionary, so that obscure words like "wether" wouldn't
 mask favorite typos.
\layout Itemize

(Jeff Edmonds) It would be wonderful if ispell could correct inserted spaces
 such as "th e" for "the" or even "can not" for "cannot".
\layout Itemize

Since ispell has dictionaries available to it, it is conceivable that it
 could automatically determine the language of a particular file by choosing
 the dictionary that produced the fewest spelling errors on the first few
 lines.

\layout Subsection

Word skipping by context
\layout Standard

This was posted on the Aspell mailing list on January 1, 1999:
\layout Standard

I had an idea on a great general way to determine if a word should be skipped.
 Determine the words to skip based on the symbols that (almost) always surround
 the word.
\layout Standard

For example when asked to check the following C++ code:
\layout LyX-Code

cout <
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
/
\end_inset 

< "My age is: " <
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
/
\end_inset 

< num <
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
/
\end_inset 

< endl; 
\newline 
cout <
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
/
\end_inset 

< "Next year I will be " <
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
/
\end_inset 

< num + 1 <
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
/
\end_inset 

< endl; 
\layout Standard

cout, num, and endl will all be skipped.
 "cout" will be skipped because it is always preceded by a <
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
/
\end_inset 

<.
 "num" will be skipped because it is always preceded by a <
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
/
\end_inset 

<.
 And "endl" will be skipped because it is always between a <
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
/
\end_inset 

< and a ;.
\layout Standard

Given the following html code.
\layout LyX-Code

<table width=50% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=1> 
\newline 
<tr><td>One<td>Two<td>Three 
\newline 
<tr><td>1<td>2<td>3 
\newline 
</table>
\newline 

\newline 
<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=1> 
\newline 
</table>
\layout Standard

table, width cellspacing, cellpadding, tr, td will all be skipped because
 they are always enclosed in "<>".
 Now of course table and width would be marked as correct anyway however
 there is no harm in skipping them.
\layout Standard

So I was wondering if anyone on this list has any experience in writing
 this sort of context recognition code or could give me some pointers in
 the right direction.
\layout Standard

This sort of word skipping will be very powerful if done right.
 I imagine that it could replace specific spell checker modes for Tex, Nroff,
 SGML etc because it will automatically be able to figure out where it should
 skip words.
 It could also probably do a very good job on programming languages code.
\layout Standard

If you are interested in helping be out with this or just have general comments
 about the idea please let me know.
\layout Subsection

Hidden Markov Model
\layout Standard

Knud Haugaard Sørensen suggested this one.
 From his email on the Aspell mailing list:
\layout Quote

consider this examples.
\layout Quote

a fone number.
 -> a phone number.
 
\newline 
a fone dress.
 -> a fine dress.
\layout Quote

the example illustrates that the right correction might depend on the context
 of the word.
 So I suggest that you take a look on HMM to solve this problem.
\layout Quote

This might also provide a good base to include grammar correction in aspell.
\layout Quote

see this link 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url{http://www.cse.ogi.edu/CSLU/HLTsurvey/ch1node7.html}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

I think it is a great idea.
 However unfortunately it will probably be very complicated to implement.
 Perhaps in the far future.
\layout Subsection

Email the Personal Dictionary
\layout Standard

Some one suggest in a personal email:
\layout Quote

Have you thought of adding a function to aspell, that - when the personal
 dictionary has grown significantly - sends the user's personal dictionary
 to the maintainer of the corresponding aspell dictionary? (if the user
 allows it)
\layout Quote

It would be a very useful service to the dictionary maintainers, and I think
 most users can see their benefit in it too.
\layout Standard

And I replied:
\layout Quote

Yes I have considered something like that but not for the personal dictionaries
 but rather the replacement word list in order to get better test data for
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url{http://aspell.sourceforge.net/test/}

\end_inset 

.
 The problem is I don't know of a good way to do this sense Aspell can also
 be used as a library.
 It also is not a real high priority, especially sense I would first need
 to learn how to send email within a C++ program.
\layout Subsection

Words With Spaces in Them
\layout Standard

While this is something I would like to do it is not a simple task.
 The basic problem is that when tokenizing a string there is no good way
 to keep phrases together.
 So the solution is to some how add special conditions to certain words
 which will dictate which words can come before/after it.
 Then there is also a problem of how to come up with intelligent suggestions.
 What further complicates things is that many applications send words to
 Aspell a word at a time.
 So even if Aspell did support such a thing many applications that would
 use Aspell will not.
 So, in order for this to work applications will need to send text to Aspell
 a document or at least a sentence at a time.
 Unfortunately the framework for doing this is not there yet.
 It will be once I finish the filter interface.
 Another possible is to provide call back functions in which Aspell will
 be able to request the previous or next word on request.
 Yet again the framework for doing this is not there.
 Perhaps sometime in the near future.

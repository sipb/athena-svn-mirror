<H1><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="install_toc.html#SEC2">Introduction</A></H1>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="install_toc.html#SEC3">What is Kerberos and How Does it Work?</A></H2>
<P>
Kerberos V5 is based on the Kerberos authentication system developed
at MIT.  Under Kerberos, a client (generally either a user or a service)
sends a request for a ticket to the Key Distribution Center (KDC).  The
KDC creates a <DFN>ticket-granting ticket</DFN> (TGT) for the client,
encrypts it using the client's password as the key, and sends the
encrypted TGT back to the client.  The client then attempts to decrypt
the TGT, using its password.  If the client successfully decrypts the
TGT (<I>i.e.</I>, if the client gave the correct password), it keeps the
decrypted TGT, which indicates proof of the client's identity.
<P>
The TGT, which expires at a specified time, permits the client to obtain
additional tickets, which give permission for specific services.  The
requesting and granting of these additional tickets is user-transparent.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC4" HREF="install_toc.html#SEC4">Why Should I use Kerberos?</A></H2>
<P>
Since Kerberos negotiates authenticated, and optionally encrypted,
communications between two points anywhere on the Internet, it provides
a layer of security that is not dependent on which side of a firewall
either client is on.  Since studies have shown that half of the computer
security breaches in industry happen from <I>inside</I> firewalls,
Kerberos V5 from MIT will play a vital role in the
security of your network.
<P>
This document is one piece of the document set for Kerberos V5.  The
documents, and their intended audiences, are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Kerberos V5 Installation Guide</B>:  a concise guide for installing
Kerberos V5.  Kerberos administrators (particularly whoever will be
making site-wide decisions about the installation) and the system
administrators who will be installing the software should read this
guide.
<P>
<LI>
<B>Kerberos V5 System Administrator's Guide</B>:  a sysadmin's guide to
administering a Kerberos installation.  The System Administrator's Guide
describes the administration software and suggests policies and
procedures for administering a Kerberos installation.  Anyone who will
have administrative access to your Kerberos database should read this
guide.
<P>
<LI>
<B>Kerberos V5 UNIX User's Guide</B>:  a guide to using the Kerberos
UNIX client programs.  All users on UNIX systems should read this guide,
particularly the "Tutorial" section.
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="install_toc.html#SEC5">Please Read the Documentation</A></H2>
<P>
As with any software package that uses a centrallized database, the
installation procedure is somewhat involved, and requires forethought
and planning.  MIT has attempted to make this
Kerberos V5 Installation Guide as concise as possible, rather than
making it an exhaustive description of the details of Kerberos.
Consequently, everything in this guide appears because MIT
believes that it is important.  Please read and follow these
instructions carefully.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="install_toc.html#SEC6">Overview of This Guide</A></H2>

<P>
The appendices give sample configuration files.
<P>
<H1><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="install_toc.html#SEC7">Realm Configuration Decisions</A></H1>
<P>
Before installing Kerberos V5, it is necessary to consider the
following issues:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
The name of your Kerberos realm (or the name of each realm, if you need
more than one).
<P>
<LI>
How you will map your hostnames onto Kerberos realms.
<P>
<LI>
Which ports your KDC and and kadmin (database access) services will use.
<P>
<LI>
How many slave KDCs you need and where they should be located.
<P>
<LI>
The hostnames of your master and slave KDCs.
<P>
<LI>
How frequently you will propagate the database from the master KDC to
the slave KDCs.
<P>
<LI>
Whether you need backward compatibility with Kerberos V4.
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC8" HREF="install_toc.html#SEC8">Kerberos Realms</A></H2>
<P>
Although your Kerberos realm can be any ASCII string, convention is to
make it the same as your domain name, in upper-case letters.  For
example, hosts in the domain fubar.org would be in the
Kerberos realm FUBAR.ORG.
<P>
If you need multiple Kerberos realms, MIT recommends that
you use descriptive names which end with your domain name, such as
BOSTON.FUBAR.ORG and HOUSTON.FUBAR.ORG.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC9" HREF="install_toc.html#SEC9">Mapping Hostnames onto Kerberos Realms</A></H2>
<P>
Mapping hostnames onto Kerberos realms is done through a set of rules in
the <CODE>krb5.conf</CODE> configuration file.  (See section <A HREF="install.html#SEC72">krb5.conf</A>.)  You can
specify mappings for an entire domain or subdomain, and/or on a
hostname-by-hostname basis.  Since greater specificity takes precedence,
you would do this by specifying the mappings for a given domain or
subdomain and listing the exceptions.
<P>
The Kerberos V5 System Administrator's Guide contains a thorough
description of the parts of the <CODE>krb5.conf</CODE> file and what may be
specified in each.  A sample <CODE>krb5.conf</CODE> file appears in
section <A HREF="install.html#SEC72">krb5.conf</A>.  You should be able to use this file, substituting the
relevant information for your Kerberos instllation for the samples.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC10" HREF="install_toc.html#SEC10">Ports for the KDC and Admin Services</A></H2>
<P>
The default ports used by Kerberos are port 88 for the
KDC<A NAME="FOOT1" HREF="install_foot.html#FOOT1">(1)</A>  and port 749 for the admin
server.  You can, however, choose to run on other ports, as long as they
are specified in each host's <CODE>/etc/services</CODE> and <CODE>krb5.conf</CODE>
files, and the <CODE>kdc.conf</CODE> file on each KDC.  For a more thorough
treatment of port numbers used by the Kerberos V5 programs, refer to
the "Configuring Your Firewall to Work With Kerberos V5" section
of the <CITE>Kerberos V5 System Administrator's Guide</CITE>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC11" HREF="install_toc.html#SEC11">Slave KDCs</A></H2>
<P>
Slave KDCs provide an additional source of Kerberos ticket-granting
services in the event of inaccessibility of the master KDC.  The number
of slave KDCs you need and the decision of where to place them, both
physically and logically, depends on the specifics of your network.
<P>
All of the Kerberos authentication on your network requires that each
client be able to contact a KDC.  Therefore, you need to anticipate any
likely reason a KDC might be unavailable and have a slave KDC to take up
the slack.
<P>
Some considerations include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
Have at least one slave KDC as a backup, for when the master KDC is
down, is being upgraded, or is otherwise unavailable.
<P>
<LI>
If your network is split such that a network outage is likely to cause a
network partition (some segment or segments of the network to become cut
off or isolated from other segments), have a slave KDC accessible to
each segment.
<P>
<LI>
If possible, have at least one slave KDC in a different building from
the master, in case of power outages, fires, or other localized
disasters.
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC12" HREF="install_toc.html#SEC12">Hostnames for the Master and Slave KDCs</A></H2>
<P>
MIT recommends that your KDCs have a predefined set of
CNAMEs, such as <CODE>kerberos</CODE> for the master KDC and
<CODE>kerberos-1</CODE>, <CODE>kerberos-2</CODE>, ... for the
slave KDCs.  This way, if you need to swap a machine, you only need to
change a DNS entry, rather than having to change hostnames.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC13" HREF="install_toc.html#SEC13">Database Propagation</A></H2>
<P>
The Kerberos database resides on the master KDC, and must be propagated
regularly (usually by a cron job) to the slave KDCs.  In deciding how
frequently the propagation should happen, you will need to balance the
amount of time the propagation takes against the maximum reasonable
amount of time a user should have to wait for a password change to take
effect.
<P>
If the propagation time is longer than this maximum reasonable time
(<I>e.g.,</I> you have a particularly large database, you have a lot of
slaves, or you experience frequent network delays), you may wish to
cut down on your propagation delay by performing the propagation in
parallel.  To do this, have the master KDC propagate the database to one
set of slaves, and then have each of these slaves propagate the database
to additional slaves.
<P>
<H1><A NAME="SEC14" HREF="install_toc.html#SEC14">Building Kerberos V5</A></H1>
<P>
Starting with the Beta 4 distribution, we are using a new configuration
system, which was built using the Free Software Foundation's
<SAMP>`autoconf'</SAMP> program.  This system will hopefully make Kerberos V5
much simpler to build and reduce the amount of effort required in
porting Kerberos V5 to a new platform.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC15" HREF="install_toc.html#SEC15">Build Requirements</A></H2>
<P>
In order to build Kerberos V5, you will need approximately 60-70
megabytes of disk space.  The exact amount will vary depending on the
platform and whether the distribution is compiled with debugging symbol
tables or not.
<P>
If you wish to keep a separate <DFN>build tree</DFN>, which contains the compiled
<TT>`*.o'</TT> file and executables, separate from your source tree, you
will need a <SAMP>`make'</SAMP> program which supports <SAMP>`VPATH'</SAMP>, or
you will need to use a tool such as <SAMP>`lndir'</SAMP> to produce a symbolic
link tree for your build tree.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC16" HREF="install_toc.html#SEC16">Unpacking the Sources</A></H2>
<P>
The first step in each of these build procedures is to unpack the source
distribution.  The Kerberos V5 distribution comes in two compressed tar
files.  The first file, which is generally named
<TT>`krb5-1.0.src.tar.gz'</TT>, contains the sources for all of Kerberos
except for the crypto library, which is found in the file
<TT>`krb5-1.0.crypto.tar.gz'</TT>.
<P>
Both files should be unpacked in the same directory, such as
<TT>`/u1/krb5-1.0'</TT>.  (In the rest of this document, we will assume that
you have chosen to unpack the Kerberos V5 source distribution in this
directory.  Note that the tarfiles will by default all unpack into the
<TT>`./krb5-1.0'</TT> directory, so that if your current directory is
<TT>`/u1'</TT> when you unpack the tarfiles, you will get
<TT>`/u1/krb5-1.0/src'</TT>, etc.)
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC17" HREF="install_toc.html#SEC17">Doing the Build</A></H2>
<P>
You have a number of different options in how to build Kerberos.  If you
only need to build Kerberos for one platform, using a single directory
tree which contains both the source files and the object files is the
simplest.  However, if you need to maintain Kerberos for a large number
of platforms, you will probably want to use separate build trees for
each platform. We recommend that you look at see section <A HREF="install.html#SEC27">Operating System Incompatibilities</A> for notes that we have on particular operating
systems. 
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC18" HREF="install_toc.html#SEC18">Building Within a Single Tree</A></H3>
<P>
If you don't want separate build trees for each architecture, then
use the following abbreviated procedure.
<P>
<OL>
<LI>
 <CODE>cd /u1/krb5-1.0/src</CODE>
<LI>
 <CODE>./configure</CODE>
<LI>
 <CODE>make</CODE>
</OL>
<P>
That's it!
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC19" HREF="install_toc.html#SEC19">Building with Separate Build Directories</A></H3>
<P>
If you wish to keep separate build directories for each platform, you
can do so using the following procedure.  (Note, this requires that your
<SAMP>`make'</SAMP> program support <SAMP>`VPATH'</SAMP>.  GNU's make will provide this
functionality, for example.)  If your <SAMP>`make'</SAMP> program does not
support this, see the next section.
<P>
For example, if you wish to create a build directory for <CODE>pmax</CODE> binaries
you might use the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>
<CODE>mkdir /u1/krb5-1.0/pmax</CODE>
<LI>
 <CODE>cd /u1/krb5-1.0/pmax</CODE>
<LI>
 <CODE>../src/configure</CODE>
<LI>
 <CODE>make</CODE>
</OL>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC20" HREF="install_toc.html#SEC20">Building Using <SAMP>`lndir'</SAMP></A></H3>
<P>
If you wish to keep separate build directories for each platform, and
you do not have access to a <SAMP>`make'</SAMP> program which supports <SAMP>`VPATH'</SAMP>,
all is not lost.  You can use the <SAMP>`lndir'</SAMP> program to create
symbolic link trees in your build directory.
<P>
For example, if you wish to create a build directory for solaris binaries
you might use the following procedure:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>
 <CODE>mkdir /u1/krb5-1.0/solaris</CODE>
<LI>
 <CODE>cd /u1/krb5-1.0/solaris</CODE>
<LI>
 <CODE>/u1/krb5-1.0/src/util/lndir `pwd`/../src</CODE>
<LI>
 <CODE>./configure</CODE>
<LI>
 <CODE>make</CODE>
</OL>
<P>
You must give an absolute pathname to <SAMP>`lndir'</SAMP> because it has a bug that
makes it fail for relative pathnames. Note that this version differs
from the latest version as distributed and installed by the XConsortium
with X11R6. Either version should be acceptable.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC21" HREF="install_toc.html#SEC21">Testing the Build</A></H2>
<P>
The Kerberos V5 distribution comes with built-in regression tests.  To
run them, simply type the following command while in the top-level build
directory (i.e., the directory where you sent typed <SAMP>`make'</SAMP> to start
building Kerberos; see section <A HREF="install.html#SEC17">Doing the Build</A>.): 
<P>
<PRE>
% make check
</PRE>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC22" HREF="install_toc.html#SEC22">The DejaGnu Tests</A></H3>
<P>
Some of the built-in regression tests are setup to use the DejaGnu
framework for running tests. These tests tend to be more comprehensive
than the normal built-in tests as they setup test servers and test
client/server activities. 
<P>
DejaGnu may be found wherever GNU software is archived.  
<P>
Most of the tests are setup to run as a non-privledged user.  For some
of the krb-root tests to work properly, either (a) the user running the
tests must not have a .k5login file in the home directory or (b) the
.k5login file must contain an entry for <CODE>&#60;username&#62;@KRBTEST.COM</CODE>.
There are two series of tests (<SAMP>`rlogind'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`telnetd'</SAMP>) which
require the ability to <SAMP>`rlogin'</SAMP> as root to the local
machine. Admittedly, this does require the use of a <TT>`.rhosts'</TT> file
or some authenticated means. <A NAME="FOOT2" HREF="install_foot.html#FOOT2">(2)</A>
<P>
If you cannot obtain root access to your machine, all the other tests
will still run. Note however, with DejaGnu 1.2, the "untested testcases"
will cause the testsuite to exit with a non-zero exit status which
<SAMP>`make'</SAMP> will consider a failure of the testing process. Do not worry
about this, as these tests are the last run when <SAMP>`make check'</SAMP> is
executed from the top level of the build tree.  This problem does not
exist with DejaGnu 1.3.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC23" HREF="install_toc.html#SEC23">The KADM5 Tests</A></H3>
<P>
Regression tests for the KADM5 system, including the GSS-RPC, KADM5
client and server libraries, and kpasswd, are also included in this
release.  Each set of KADM5 tests is contained in a sub-directory called
<CODE>unit-test</CODE> directly below the system being tested.  For example,
lib/rpc/unit-test contains the tests for GSS-RPC.  The tests are all
based on DejaGnu (but they are not actually called part of "The DejaGnu
tests," whose naming predates the inclusion of the KADM5 system).  In
addition, they require the Tool Command Language (TCL) header files and
libraries to be available during compilation and some of the tests also
require Perl in order to operate.  If all of these resources are not
available during configuration, the KADM5 tests will not run.  The TCL
installation directory can be specified with the <CODE>--with-tcl</CODE>
configure option (see See section <A HREF="install.html#SEC24">Options to Configure</A>).  The runtest and
perl programs must be in the current execution path.
<P>
If you install DejaGnu, TCL, or Perl after configuring and building
Kerberos and then want to run the KADM5 tests, you will need to
re-configure the tree and run <CODE>make</CODE> at the top level again to make
sure all the proper programs are built.  To save time, you actually only
need to reconfigure and build in the directories src/kadmin/testing,
src/lib/rpc, src/lib/kadm5, and src/kpasswd.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC24" HREF="install_toc.html#SEC24">Options to Configure</A></H2>
<P>
There are a number of options to <SAMP>`configure'</SAMP> which you can use to
control how the Kerberos distribution is built.  The following table
lists the most commonly used options to Kerberos V5's <SAMP>`configure'</SAMP>
program.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<P>
<DT><CODE>--help</CODE>
<DD><P>
Provides help to configure. This will list the set of commonly used
options for building Kerberos.
<P>
<DT><CODE>--prefix=PREFIX</CODE>
<DD><P>
By default, Kerberos will install the package's files rooted at
`/usr/local' as in `/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/sbin', etc. If you
desire a different location, use this option.
<P>
<DT><CODE>--exec-prefix=EXECPREFIX</CODE>
<DD><P>
This option allows one to separate the architecture independent programs
from the configuration files and manual pages. 
<P>
<DT><CODE>--localstatedir=LOCALSTATEDIR</CODE>
<DD><P>
This option sets the directory for locally modifiable single-machine
data.  In Kerberos, this mostly is useful for setting a location for the
KDC data files, as they will be installed in
<CODE>LOCALSTATEDIR/krb5kdc</CODE>, which is by default
<CODE>PREFIX/var/krb5kdc</CODE>.
<P>
<DT><CODE>--with-cc=COMPILER</CODE>
<DD><P>
Use <CODE>COMPILER</CODE> as the C compiler.
<P>
<DT><CODE>--with-ccopts=FLAGS</CODE>
<DD><P>
Use <CODE>FLAGS</CODE> as the default set of C compiler flags.
<P>
Note that if you use the native Ultrix compiler on a
DECstation you are likely to lose if you pass no flags to cc; md4.c
takes an estimated 3,469 billion years to compile if you provide neither
the <SAMP>`-g'</SAMP> flag nor the <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP> flag to <SAMP>`cc'</SAMP>.
<P>
<DT><CODE>--with-cppopts=CPPOPTS</CODE>
<DD><P>
Use <CODE>CPPOPTS</CODE> as the default set of C preprocessor flags.  The most
common use of this option is to select certain <CODE>#define</CODE>'s for use
with the operating system's include files.
<P>
<DT><CODE>--with-linker=LINKER</CODE>
<DD><P>
Use <CODE>LINKER</CODE> as the default loader if it should be different from C
compiler as specified above.
<P>
<DT><CODE>--with-ldopts=LDOPTS</CODE>
<DD><P>
This option allows one to specify optional arguments to be passed to the
linker. This might be used to specify optional library paths.
<P>
<DT><CODE>--with-krb4</CODE>
<DD><P>
This option enables Kerberos V4 backwards compatibility using the
builtin Kerberos V4 library.
<P>
<DT><CODE>--with-krb4=KRB4DIR</CODE>
<DD><P>
This option enables Kerberos V4 backwards compatibility using a
pre-existing Kerberos V4 installation.  The directory specified by
<CODE>KRB4DIR</CODE> specifies where the V4 header files should be found
(<TT>`KRB4DIR/include'</TT>) as well as where the V4 Kerberos library should
be found (<TT>`KRB4DIR/lib'</TT>).
<P>
<DT><CODE>--without-krb4</CODE>
<DD><P>
Disables Kerberos V4 backwards compatibility. This prevents Kerberos V4
clients from using the V5 services including the KDC. This would be
useful if you know you will never install or need to interact with V4
clients. 
<P>
<DT><CODE>--with-netlib[=libs]</CODE>
<DD><P>
Allows for suppression of or replacement of network libraries. By
default, Kerberos V5 configuration will look for <CODE>-lnsl</CODE> and
<CODE>-lsocket</CODE>. If your operating system has a broken resolver library
(see section <A HREF="install.html#SEC33">Solaris versions 2.0 through 2.3</A>) or fails to pass the tests in
<TT>`src/tests/resolv'</TT> you will need to use this option.
<P>
<DT><CODE>--enable-shared</CODE>
<DD><P>
This option will turn on the building and use of shared library objects
in the Kerberos build. This option is only supported on certain
platforms. 
<P>
<DT><CODE>--with-vague-errors</CODE>
<DD><P>
If enabled, gives vague and unhelpful error messages to the client... er,
attacker.  (Needed to meet silly government regulations; most other
sites will want to keep this undefined.)
<P>
<DT><CODE>--with-kdc-kdb-update</CODE>

Set this option if you want to allow the KDC to modify the Kerberos
database; this allows the last request information to be updated, as
well as the failure count information.  Note that this doesn't work if
you're using slave servers!!!  It also causes the database to be
modified (and thus needing to be locked) frequently. Please note that
the implementors do not regularly test this feature.

<P>
Shared library support is provided for a few operating systems. There
are restrictions as to which compiler to use when using shared
libraries. In all cases, executables linked with the shared libraries in
this build process will have built in the location of the libraries,
therefore obliterating the need for special LD_LIBRARY_PATH, et al environment
variables when using the programs. Except where noted, multiple versions
of the libraries may be installed on the same system and continue to
work.
<P>
Currently the supported platforms are: NetBSD 1.0A, AIX 3.2.5, AIX 4.1,
Solaris 2.4 (aka SunOS 5.4), Alpha OSF/1 &#62;= 2.1, HP-UX &#62;= 9.X.

Using the native compiler, compiling with the <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP> compiler flag

BSDI versions 1.0 and 1.1 reportedly has a bad <SAMP>`sed'</SAMP> which causes

The native compiler for HPUX currently will not work, because it is not

<P>
The <CODE>gethostbyname()</CODE> routine is broken; it does not return a fully
qualified domain name, even if you are using the Domain Name Service
routines.  Since Kerberos V5 uses the fully qualified domain name as the
second component of a service principal (i.e,
<SAMP>`host/tsx-11.mit.edu@ATHENA.MIT.EDU'</SAMP>), this causes problems for servers
who try to figure out their own fully qualified domain name.

In most of the Kerberos V5 source directories, there is a
<TT>`configure'</TT> script which automatically determines the compilation
environment and creates the proper Makefiles for a particular platform.
These <TT>`configure'</TT> files are generated using <SAMP>`autoconf'</SAMP> version
2.4, which can be found in the <TT>`src/util/autoconf'</TT> directory in the

<H1><A NAME="SEC38" HREF="install_toc.html#SEC38">Installing Kerberos V5</A></H1>
<P>
The sections of this chapter describe procedures for installing
Kerberos V5 on:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>
The KDCs
<P>
<LI>
UNIX client machines
<P>
<LI>
UNIX Application Servers
</OL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC39" HREF="install_toc.html#SEC39">Installing KDCs</A></H2>
<P>
The Key Distribution Centers (KDCs) issue Kerberos tickets.  Each KDC
contains a copy of the Kerberos database.  The master KDC contains the
master copy of the database, which it propagates to the slave KDCs at
regular intervals.  All database changes (such as password changes) are
made on the master KDC.
<P>
Slave KDCs provide Kerberos ticket-granting services, but not database
administration.  This allows clients to continue to obtain tickets when
the master KDC is unavailable.
<P>
MIT recommends that you install all of your KDCs to be able
to function as either the master or one of the slaves.  This will enable
you to easily switch your master KDC with one of the slaves if
necessary.  (See section <A HREF="install.html#SEC58">Switching Master and Slave KDCs</A>.)  This installation
procedure is based on that recommendation.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC40" HREF="install_toc.html#SEC40">Install the Master KDC</A></H3>
<P>
This installation procedure will require you to go back and forth a
couple of times between the master KDC and each of the slave KDCs.  The
first few steps must be done on the master KDC.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SEC41" HREF="install_toc.html#SEC41">Edit the Configuration Files</A></H4>
<P>
Modify the configuration files, <CODE>/etc/krb5.conf</CODE>
(see section <A HREF="install.html#SEC72">krb5.conf</A>) and <CODE>/usr/local/var/krb5kdc/kdc.conf</CODE>
(see section <A HREF="install.html#SEC73">kdc.conf</A>) to reflect the correct information (such as the
hostnames and realm name) for your realm.  MIT recommends
that you keep <CODE>krb5.conf</CODE> in <CODE>/etc</CODE>.
<P>
Among the settings in your <CODE>/etc/krb5.conf</CODE> file, be sure to create
a <CODE>[logging]</CODE> stanza so that the KDC and kadmind will generate
logging output.  For example:
<P>
<PRE>
[logging]
    kdc = FILE:/var/log/krb5kdc.log
    admin_server = FILE:/var/log/kadmin.log
    default = FILE:/var/log/krb5lib.log
</PRE>
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SEC42" HREF="install_toc.html#SEC42">Create the Database</A></H4>
<P>
You will use the <CODE>kdb5_util</CODE> command <EM>on the Master KDC</EM> to
create the Kerberos database and the optional stash file.  The
<DFN>stash file</DFN> is a local copy of the master key that resides in
encrypted form on the KDC's local disk.  The stash file is used to
authenticate the KDC to itself automatically before starting the
<CODE>kadmind</CODE> and <CODE>krb5kdc</CODE> daemons (<I>e.g.,</I> as part of the
machine's boot sequence).  The stash file, like the keytab file
(See section <A HREF="install.html#SEC65">The Keytab File</A>) is a potential point-of-entry for a break-in,
and if compromised, would allow unrestricted access to the Kerberos
database.  If you choose to install a stash file, it should be readable
only by root, and should exist only on the KDC's local disk.  The file
should not be part of any backup of the machine, unless access to the
backup data is secured as tightly as access to the master password
itself.
<P>
Note that <CODE>kdb5_util</CODE> will prompt you for the master key for the
Kerberos database.  This key can be any string.  A good key is one you
can remember, but that no one else can guess.  Examples of bad keys are
words that can be found in a dictionary, any common or popular name,
especially a famous person (or cartoon character), your username in any
form (<I>e.g.</I>, forward, backward, repeated twice, <I>etc.</I>), and any of
the sample keys that appear in this manual.  One example of a key which
might be good if it did not appear in this manual is "MITiys4K5!",
which represents the sentence "MIT is your source for Kerberos 5!"
(It's the first letter of each word, substituting the numeral "4" for
the word "for", and includes the punctuation mark at the end.)
<P>
The following is an example of how to create a Kerberos database and
stash file on the master KDC, using the <CODE>kdb5_util</CODE> command.  (The
line that begins with => is a continuation of the previous line.)
Replace <I>ATHENA.MIT.EDU</I> with the name of your Kerberos realm.
<P>
<PRE>
<B>shell%</B> /usr/local/sbin/kdb5_util create -r ATHENA.MIT.EDU -s
<B>Initializing database '/usr/local/var/krb5kdc/principal' for
=> realm 'ATHENA.MIT.EDU',
master key name 'K/M@ATHENA.MIT.EDU'
You will be prompted for the database Master Password.
It is important that you NOT FORGET this password.</B>
<B>Enter KDC database master key:</B>  <I>@doubleleftarrow{</I> Type the master password.}
<B>Re-enter KDC database master key to verify:</B>  <I>@doubleleftarrow{</I> Type it again.}
<B>shell%</B>
</PRE>
<P>
This will create five files in the directory specified in your
<CODE>kdc.conf</CODE> file:  two Kerberos database files, <CODE>principal.db</CODE>,
and <CODE>principal.ok</CODE>; the Kerberos administrative database file,
<CODE>principal.kadm5</CODE>; the administrative database lock file,
<CODE>principal.kadm5.lock</CODE>; and the stash file, <CODE>.k5stash</CODE>.  (The
default directory is <CODE>/usr/local/var/krb5kdc</CODE>.)  If you do not
want a stash file, run the above command without the <CODE>-s</CODE> option.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SEC43" HREF="install_toc.html#SEC43">Add Administrators to the Acl File</A></H4>
<P>
Next, you need create an Access Control List (acl) file, and put the
Kerberos principal of at least one of the administrators into it.  The
filename should match the value you have set for "acl_file" in your
<CODE>kdc.conf</CODE> file.  The default file name is <SAMP>`kadm5.acl'</SAMP>.  The
format of the file is:
<P>
<PRE>
Kerberos principal      permissions     optional target principal
</PRE>
<P>
The Kerberos principal (and optional target principal) can include the
"<B>*</B>" wildcard, so if you want any principal with the instance
"admin" to have full permissions on the database, you could use the
principal "<CODE>*/admin@REALM</CODE>" where "REALM" is your Kerberos
realm.
<P>
Note:  a common use of an <I>admin</I> instance is so you can grant
separate permissions (such as administrator access to the Kerberos
database) to a separate Kerberos principal.  For example, the user
<CODE>joeadmin</CODE> might have a principal for his administrative
use, called <CODE>joeadmin/admin</CODE>.  This way,
<CODE>joeadmin</CODE> would obtain <CODE>joeadmin/admin</CODE>
tickets only when he actually needs to use those permissions.  Refer to
the Kerberos V5 Administrator's Guide or the Kerberos V5 User's
Guide for more detailed explanations of <DFN>principals</DFN> and
<DFN>instances</DFN>.
<P>
The permissions (acls) recognized in the acl file 
are the following:

<P>
It is not actually necessary to have the master KDC server in the
Kerberos database, but it can be handy if:
<P>
<UL>

anyone will be logging into the machine as something other than root
<P>
<LI>
you want to be able to swap the master KDC with one of the slaves if
necessary.
</UL>
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SEC49" HREF="install_toc.html#SEC49">Extract Host Keytabs for the KDCs</A></H4>
<P>
Each KDC (including the master) needs a keytab to decrypt tickets.
Ideally, you should extract each keytab locally on its own KDC.  If this
is not feasible, you should use an encrypted session to send them across
the network.  To extract a keytab on a KDC called
kerberos.mit.edu, you would execute the following
command:
<P>
<PRE>
<B>kadmin:</B> ktadd host/kerberos.mit.edu
<B>kadmin: Entry for principal host/kerberos.mit.edu@ATHENA.MIT.EDU with
     kvno 1, encryption type DES-CBC-CRC added to keytab
     WRFILE:/etc/krb5.keytab.
kadmin:</B>
</PRE>
<P>
Note that the principal must exist in the Kerberos database in order to
extract the keytab.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SEC50" HREF="install_toc.html#SEC50">Set Up the Slave KDCs for Database Propagation</A></H4>
<P>
The database is propagated from the master KDC to the slave KDCs via the
<CODE>kpropd</CODE> daemon.  To set up propagation, create a file on each KDC,
named <CODE>/usr/local/var/krb5kdc/kpropd.acl</CODE>, containing the
principals for each of the KDCs.
For example, if the master KDC were
<CODE>kerberos.mit.edu</CODE>, the slave KDCs were
<CODE>kerberos-1.mit.edu</CODE> and
<CODE>kerberos-2.mit.edu</CODE>, and the realm were
<CODE>ATHENA.MIT.EDU</CODE>, then the file's contents would be:
<P>
<PRE>
host/kerberos.mit.edu@ATHENA.MIT.EDU
host/kerberos-1.mit.edu@ATHENA.MIT.EDU
host/kerberos-2.mit.edu@ATHENA.MIT.EDU
</PRE>
 
Then, add the following lines to <CODE>/etc/inetd.conf</CODE> file on each KDC
(the line beginnng with => is a continuation of the previous
line):
<P>
<PRE>
krb5_prop stream tcp nowait root /usr/local/sbin/kpropd kpropd
eklogin   stream tcp nowait root /usr/local/sbin/klogind 
=> klogind -k -c -e
</PRE>
<P>
The first line sets up the <CODE>kpropd</CODE> database propagation daemon.
The second line sets up the <CODE>eklogin</CODE> daemon, allowing
Kerberos-authenticated, encrypted rlogin to the KDC.
<P>
You also need to add the following lines to <CODE>/etc/services</CODE> on each
KDC:
<P>
<PRE>
kerberos        88/udp      kdc       # Kerberos authentication (udp)
kerberos        88/tcp      kdc       # Kerberos authentication (tcp)

<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC51" HREF="install_toc.html#SEC51">Back on the Master KDC</A></H3>
<P>
Now that the slave KDCs are able to accept database propagation, you'll
need to propagate the database to each of them.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SEC52" HREF="install_toc.html#SEC52">Propagate the Database to Each Slave KDC</A></H4>
<P>
First, create a dump of the database on the master KDC, as follows:
<P>
<PRE>
<B>shell%</B> /usr/local/sbin/kdb5_util dump /usr/local/var/krb5kdc/slave_datatrans
<B>shell%</B>
</PRE>
<P>
Next, you need to manually propagate the database to each slave KDC, as
in the following example.  (The lines beginning with => are
continuations of the previous line.):
<P>
<PRE>
/usr/local/sbin/kprop -f /usr/local/var/krb5kdc/slave_datatrans
=> kerberos-1.mit.edu
/usr/local/sbin/kprop -f /usr/local/var/krb5kdc/slave_datatrans
=> kerberos-2.mit.edu
</PRE>
<P>
You will need a script to dump and propagate the database.  The
following is an example of a bourne shell script that will do this.
(Note that the line that begins with => is a continuation of the
previous line.  Remember that you need to replace /usr/local with
the name of the directory in which you installed Kerberos V5.)
<P>
<PRE>
#!/bin/sh

kdclist = "kerberos-1.mit.edu kerberos-2.mit.edu"

/usr/local/sbin/kdb5_util -R "dump

for kdc in $kdclist
do
/usr/local/sbin/kprop -f /usr/local/var/krb5kdc/slave_datatrans $kdc
done
</PRE>
<P>
You will need to set up a cron job to run this script at the intervals
you decided on earlier (See section <A HREF="install.html#SEC13">Database Propagation</A>.)
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC53" HREF="install_toc.html#SEC53">Finish Installing the Slave KDCs</A></H3>
<P>
Now that the slave KDCs have copies of the Kerberos database, you can
create stash files for them and start the <CODE>krb5kdc</CODE> daemon.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SEC54" HREF="install_toc.html#SEC54">Create Stash Files on the Slave KDCs</A></H4>
<P>
Create stash files, by issuing the following commands on each slave KDC:
<P>
<PRE>
<B>shell%</B> kdb5_util stash
<B>kdb5_util: Cannot find/read stored master key while reading master key
kdb5_util: Warning: proceeding without master key</B>
<B>Enter KDC database master key:</B>  <I>@doubleleftarrow{</I> Enter the database master key.}
<B>shell%</B>
</PRE>
<P>
As mentioned above, the stash file is necessary for your KDCs to be able
authenticate to themselves, such as when they reboot.  You could run
your KDCs without stash files, but you would then need to type in the
Kerberos database master key by hand every time you start a KDC daemon.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SEC55" HREF="install_toc.html#SEC55">Start the krb5kdc Daemon on Each KDC</A></H4>
<P>
The final step in configuing your slave KDCs is to run the KDC daemon:
<P>
<PRE>
<B>shell%</B> /usr/local/sbin/krb5kdc
</PRE>
<P>
As with the master KDC, you will probably want to add this command to
the KDCs' <CODE>/etc/rc</CODE> or <CODE>/etc/inittab</CODE> files, so they will
start the krb5kdc daemon automatically at boot time.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC56" HREF="install_toc.html#SEC56">Add Kerberos Principals to the Database</A></H3>
<P>
Once your KDCs are set up and running, you are ready to use
<CODE>kadmin</CODE> to load principals for your users, hosts, and other
services into the Kerberos database.  This procedure is described fully in the
"Adding or Modifying Principals" section of the Kerberos V5 System
Administrator's Guide.  (See section <A HREF="install.html#SEC48">Create Host Keys for the Slave KDCs</A> for a
brief description.)  The keytab is generated by running <CODE>kadmin</CODE>
and issuing the <CODE>ktadd</CODE> command.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC57" HREF="install_toc.html#SEC57">Limit Access to the KDCs</A></H3>
<P>
To limit the possibility that your Kerberos database could be
compromised, MIT recommends that each KDC be a dedicated
host, with limited access.  If your KDC is also a file server, FTP
server, Web server, or even just a client machine, someone who obtained
root access through a security hole in any of those areas could gain
access to the Kerberos database.
<P>
MIT recommends that your KDCs use the following

<P>
MIT recommends that you use <CODE>login.krb5</CODE> in place of

need to make sure your users know to use their Kerberos passwords when
they log in.

<H2><A NAME="SEC62" HREF="install_toc.html#SEC62">UNIX Application Servers</A></H2>

An application server is a host that provides one or more services over
the network.  Application servers can be "secure" or "insecure."  A
"secure" host is set up to require authentication from every client
connecting to it.  An "insecure" host will still provide Kerberos
authentication, but will also allow unauthenticated clients to connect.
<P>
If you have Kerberos V5 installed on all of your client machines,
MIT recommends that you make your hosts secure, to take
advantage of the security that Kerberos authentication affords.
However, if you have some clients that do not have Kerberos V5
installed, you can run an insecure server, and still take advantage of
Kerberos V5's single sign-on on capability.

<H3><A NAME="SEC65" HREF="install_toc.html#SEC65">The Keytab File</A></H3>
<P>
All Kerberos server machines need a <DFN>keytab</DFN> file, called
<CODE>/etc/krb5.keytab</CODE> (See section <A HREF="install.html#SEC69">Upgrading the application servers</A>), to
authenticate to the KDC.  The keytab file is an encrypted, local,
on-disk copy of the host's key.  The keytab file, like the stash file
(section <A HREF="install.html#SEC42">Create the Database</A>) is a potential point-of-entry for a
break-in, and if compromised, would allow unrestricted access to its
host.  The keytab file should be readable only by root, and should exist
only on the machine's local disk.  The file should not be part of any
backup of the machine, unless access to the backup data is secured as
tightly as access to the machine's root password itself.
<P>
In order to generate a keytab for a host, the host must have a principal
in the Kerberos database.  The procedure for adding hosts to the
database is described fully in the "Adding or Modifying Principals"
section of the <CITE>Kerberos V5 System Administrator's Guide</CITE>.
See section <A HREF="install.html#SEC48">Create Host Keys for the Slave KDCs</A> for a brief description.)
The keytab is generated by running <CODE>kadmin</CODE> and issuing the
<CODE>ktadd</CODE> command.
<P>
For example, to generate a keytab file to allow the host
trillium.mit.edu to authenticate for the services
<CODE>host</CODE>, <CODE>ftp</CODE>, and <CODE>pop</CODE>, the administrator
<CODE>joeadmin</CODE> would issue the command (on
trillium.mit.edu):
<P>

<P>
If you generate the keytab file on another host, you need to get a copy
of the keytab file onto the destination host (<CODE>trillium</CODE>, in the
above example) without sending it unencrypted over the network.  If you
have installed the Kerberos V5 client programs, you can use
encrypted <CODE>rcp</CODE>.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC66" HREF="install_toc.html#SEC66">Some Advice about Secure Hosts</A></H3>
<P>
Kerberos V5 can protect your host from certain types of break-ins,
but it is possible to install Kerberos V5 and still leave your host
vulnerable to attack.  Obviously an installation guide is not the place
to try to include an exhaustive list of countermeasures for every
possible attack, but it is worth noting some of the larger holes and how
to close them.
<P>
As stated earlier in this section, MIT recommends that on a
secure host, you disable the standard <CODE>ftp</CODE>, <CODE>login</CODE>,
<CODE>telnet</CODE>, <CODE>shell</CODE>, and <CODE>exec</CODE> services in
<CODE>/etc/inetd.conf</CODE>.  We also recommend that secure hosts have an empty
<CODE>/etc/hosts.equiv</CODE> file and that there not be a <CODE>.rhosts</CODE> file
in <CODE>root</CODE>'s home directory.  You can grant Kerberos-authenticated
root access to specific Kerberos principals by placing those principals
in the file <CODE>.k5login</CODE> in root's home directory.
<P>
We recommend that backups of secure machines exclude the keytab file
(<CODE>/etc/krb5.keytab</CODE>).  If this is not possible, the backups should
at least be done locally, rather than over a network, and the backup
tapes should be physically secured.
<P>
Finally, the keytab file and any programs run by root, including the
Kerberos V5 binaries, should be kept on local disk.  The keytab file
should be readable only by root.

The process for upgrading a Slave KDC is simpler.  All you have to do is
make sure that the stash file on the Slave KDC is correct, stop the old
server processes on the Slave KDC, install the new server binaries, and
re-start the server processes.  The Slave KDC database will be upgraded
automatically when the next propagation is run.  Note that if you
changed your master key when creating your new Master KDC database, you
will have to run a Slave KDC propagation before you can restart the
server processes on the Slave KDC itself; otherwise, the new stash file
that you create on the slave will not match the old database that exists
until the propagation occurs, and the server processes will not start.

<P>
The default keytab name has changed from <CODE>/etc/v5srvtab</CODE> to
<CODE>/etc/krb5.keytab</CODE>.  You should rename the old keytab files on all
of your application servers when you update their server binaries.
Alternatively, you may add a relation to the library configuration file
to override the new name, for example:
<P>
<PRE>
[libdefaults]
    default_keytab_name = /etc/v5srvtab
</PRE>
<P>
The keytab name defaulted to /etc/v5srvtab in prior releases of Kerberos
V5.  It was called a <DFN>srvtab</DFN> in Kerberos V4.  The <CODE>v5srvtab</CODE>
file has been renamed to <CODE>krb5.keytab</CODE> to reflect the change in
terminology.

<H1><A NAME="SEC70" HREF="install_toc.html#SEC70">Bug Reports for Kerberos V5</A></H1>
<P>
In any complex software, there will be bugs.  If you have successfully
built and installed Kerberos V5, please use the
<CODE>krb5-send-pr</CODE> program to fill out a Problem Report.
<P>
Bug reports that include proposed fixes are especially welcome.  If you
do include fixes, please send them using either context diffs or unified
diffs (using <SAMP>`diff -c'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`diff -u'</SAMP>, respectively).
<P>
The <CODE>krb5-send-pr</CODE> program is installed in the directory
<CODE>/usr/local/sbin</CODE>.
<P>
The <CODE>krb5-send-pr</CODE> program enters the problem report into our
Problem Report Management System (PRMS), which automatically assigns it
to the engineer best able to help you with problems in the assigned
category.
<P>
The <CODE>krb5-send-pr</CODE> program will try to intelligently fill in as
many fields as it can.  You need to choose the <DFN>category</DFN>,
<DFN>class</DFN>, <DFN>severity</DFN>, and <DFN>priority</DFN> of the problem, as well
as giving us as much information as you can about its exact nature.
<P>
The PR <B>category</B> will be one of:
<P>
<PRE>
krb5-admin   krb5-appl    krb5-build   krb5-clients 
krb5-doc     krb5-kdc     krb5-libs    krb5-misc    
pty          telnet       test         
</PRE>
<P>
Choose the category that best describes the area under which your
problem falls.
<P>
The <B>class</B> can be <DFN>sw-bug</DFN>, <DFN>doc-bug</DFN>, <DFN>change-request</DFN>,
or <DFN>support</DFN>.  The first two are exactly as their names imply.  Use
<I>change-request</I> when the software is behaving according to
specifications, but you want to request changes in some feature or
behavior.  The <I>support</I> class is intended for more general questions
about building or using Kerberos V5.
<P>
The <B>severity</B> of the problem indicates the problem's impact on the
usability of Kerberos V5.  If a problem is <DFN>critical</DFN>, that
means the product, component or concept is completely non-operational,
or some essential functionality is missing, and no workaround is known.
A <DFN>serious</DFN> problem is one in which the product, component or
concept is not working properly or significant functionality is missing.
Problems that would otherwise be considered <I>critical</I> are rated
<I>serious</I> when a workaround is known.  A <DFN>non-critical</DFN> problem is
one that is indeed a problem, but one that is having a minimal effect on
your ability to use Kerberos V5.  <I>E.g.</I>, The product, component
or concept is working in general, but lacks features, has irritating
behavior, does something wrong, or doesn't match its documentation.  The
default severity is <I>serious</I>.
<P>
The <B>priority</B> indicates how urgent this particular problem is in
relation to your work.  Note that low priority does not imply low
importance.
A priority of <DFN>high</DFN> means a solution is needed as soon as possible.
A priority of <DFN>medium</DFN> means the problem should be solved no later
than the next release.  A priority of <DFN>low</DFN> means the problem should
be solved in a future release, but it is not important to your work how
soon this happens.  The default priority is <I>medium</I>.
<P>
Note that a given severity does not necessarily imply a given priority.
For example, a non-critical problem might still have a high priority if
you are faced with a hard deadline.  Conversely, a serious problem might
have a low priority if the feature it is disabling is one that you do
not need.
<P>
It is important that you fill in the <I>release</I> field and tell us
what changes you have made, if any.
<P>
Bug reports that include proposed fixes are especially welcome.  If you
include proposed fixes, please send them using either context diffs
(<SAMP>`diff -c'</SAMP>) or unified diffs (<SAMP>`diff -u'</SAMP>).

If the <CODE>krb5-send-pr</CODE> program does not work for you, or if you did
not get far enough in the process to have an installed and working

<H3><A NAME="SEC74" HREF="install_toc.html#SEC74">Encryption Types and Salt Types</A></H3>
<P>
Currently, Kerberos V5 supports only DES encryption.  The encoding
type is <CODE>des-cbc-crc</CODE>.  The <DFN>salt</DFN> is additional information
encoded within the key that tells what kind of key it is.  The only
salts that you will be likely to encounter are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><DFN>normal</DFN>, which MIT recommends using for all of
your Kerberos V5 keys
<P>
<LI><DFN>v4</DFN>, which is necessary only for compatibility with a v4 KDC
<P>
<LI><DFN>afs</DFN>, which you will never need to generate, and which you will
encounter only if you dump an AFS database into a Kerberos database
</UL>
<P>
Support for additional encryption types is planned in the future.

debathena-cupsys-config (1.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Set the new printer as default if there isn't already a default (Trac:
    #1017)

 -- Jonathan Reed <jdreed@mit.edu>  Wed, 10 Aug 2011 17:56:04 -0400

debathena-cupsys-config (1.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bump Conflicts statement for new cluster-cups-config
  * Fix prerm syntax

debathena-cupsys-config (1.14) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Geoffrey Thomas ]
  * No need to make restart_cups.sh executable, since it's only intended
    to be included in other scripts and doesn't do anything if you
    execute it (since it just defines a function).
    This addresses Lintian warning executable-not-elf-or-script.

  [ Jonathan Reed ]
  * Stop BrowsePolling and just add the mitprint printer.  Remove any
    printers added by cluster-cups-config at upgrade time
  * Replace/Conflict/Provide debathena-cluster-cups-config
  * Bump standards-version

 -- Jonathan Reed <jdreed@mit.edu>  Fri, 29 Jul 2011 08:23:43 -0400

debathena-cupsys-config (1.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * No changes, version bump to resolve 1.12 disparity issues

 -- Jonathan Reed <jdreed@mit.edu>  Mon, 07 Mar 2011 14:56:24 -0500

debathena-cupsys-config (1.12) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Jonathan Reed ]
  * Change the diversion of cupsd.conf so that it includes a separate file
  * Make restart_cups aware of this new file

  [ Geoffrey Thomas ]
  * Permit restart_cups to take a callback restart_cups_extra to do
    other stuff while cups is down (or if we're not restarting it)

 -- Geoffrey Thomas <geofft@mit.edu>  Mon, 23 Aug 2010 04:12:45 -0400

debathena-cupsys-config (1.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * In restart-cups.sh, temporarily spawn our own instance cups-polld to
    quickly feed the printer list into cupsd and kill it when we're
    done. (Trac: #562)
  * Now that we expect restart-cups.sh to be fast (order of 2-4 seconds),
    drop the timeout to something more reasonable (30 seconds).
  * Bump debhelper compatibility.
  * Bump standards version.

 -- Evan Broder <broder@mit.edu>  Mon, 03 May 2010 23:41:20 -0400

debathena-cupsys-config (1.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Tell the user why it's sitting there for 2 minutes in the postinst

 -- Jonathan Reed <jdreed@mit.edu>  Thu, 29 Apr 2010 11:30:25 -0400

debathena-cupsys-config (1.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Refactor the CUPS-restarting logic into a separate shell script so that
    other postinsts can share code with it.
  * Merge in some of reactivate's CUPS-restarting logic.

 -- Geoffrey Thomas <geofft@mit.edu>  Mon, 08 Mar 2010 17:23:24 -0500

debathena-cupsys-config (1.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Lengthen BrowseInterval and BrowseTimeout to reduce unnecessary load
    on CUPS servers when things aren't changing.

 -- Evan Broder <broder@mit.edu>  Wed, 10 Feb 2010 10:48:10 -0500

debathena-cupsys-config (1.7.1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Flush remote.cache, because CUPS isn't good at realizing that you switched
    BrowsePoll hosts and so it should forget the old server's queues.

 -- Geoffrey Thomas <geofft@mit.edu>  Wed, 10 Feb 2010 01:57:10 -0500

debathena-cupsys-config (1.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Switch from cups.mit.edu to cluster-printers.mit.edu.

 -- Evan Broder <broder@mit.edu>  Wed, 09 Dec 2009 03:02:41 -0500

debathena-cupsys-config (1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Revert version 1.5. Browsing is, in fact, needed to make BrowsePoll
    work. We'll have to wait until we have a better printing solution to
    disable local network browsing.

 -- Evan Broder <broder@mit.edu>  Mon, 18 May 2009 13:32:48 -0400

debathena-cupsys-config (1.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Disable browsing. It's not needed for BrowsePoll to work, and
    confusingly causes other print servers to show up in the GUI. (Trac:
    #229)

 -- Evan Broder <broder@mit.edu>  Thu, 30 Apr 2009 07:26:36 -0400

  * Remove debian/control from version control.
  * Clean up debian/copyright.

 -- Tim Abbott <tabbott@mit.edu>  Sat, 24 Jan 2009 17:04:38 -0500

debathena-cupsys-config (1.3) unstable; urgency=low

debathena-cupsys-config (1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Depend on cupsys-bsd, mostly as a way to restore cupsys-bsd and
    cupsys-client on systems which have lprng installed.

 -- Greg Hudson <ghudson@mit.edu>  Mon, 09 Jun 2008 11:13:40 -0400

# This script is intended to be run from a cron job by a local account
# on a build machine--either debuild on debuild.mit.edu or builder on
# linux-build-10.mit.edu.  The account should have:
#
# * A keytab installed in $HOME/keytab containing a keytab for
#   daemon/HOSTNAME, which should have write access to the build
#   directory and apt repository.
#
# * A GPG secret key capable of signing packages for the apt
#   repository.
#
# * A file named $HOME/autodebathenify.config specifying shell
#   variable assignments for:
#   - error_addr: An email address to send errors to
#   - scripts_dir: Directory containing Debathena scripts (da, etc.)
#   - build_dir: Build directory location, up through "third".
#   - packages: A list of packages to keep up to date
#   It should also specify an environment variable assignment for
#   DEBATHENA_APT.

# Send all output to a logfile.

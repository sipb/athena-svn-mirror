# This file specifies the netmasks for each network supported by the
# Athena environment.  The format for lines in the file is:
#
#	address		significant-bits	netmask-bits	[gateway]
#
# The number of netmask bits for a given IP address is the value of
# <netmask-bits> on the first line for which <address> matches the
# first <significant-bits> bits of the given address.  If a gateway
# is not given, the gateway is assumed to be one greater than the
# network address.
#
# The contents of this file are maintained by Athena release
# engineering.  If you edit this file on your workstation, it will be
# replaced at the next update and your changes will be lost.  If you
# have local changes to make, create or add to
# /etc/athena/masks.local, which has the same file format as this
# file.  Entries in /etc/athena/masks.local take precedence over
# entries in this file.
#
# The shell script /etc/athena/netparams uses this file to compute the
# network, broadcast, and gateway address for a given IP address.  See
# the comments at the top of that file for usage information.

# Most MITnet addresses begin with "18" and have a 16-bit netmask.
# 18.7 is being used in IS machine rooms with a 24-bit netmask.
# At least parts of 18.7.1 are being used as /30s for servers that
# don't like to have their IP address changed.
# Bits of LCS also have a 24-bit netmask, according to 
# wollman@lcs.mit.edu, 1/12/98.
# 18.101 is being used for IS internal experiments, with a 28 bit netmask.

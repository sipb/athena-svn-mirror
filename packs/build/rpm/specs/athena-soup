%description
Soup is a SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) implementation in C. It 
provides an queued asynchronous callback-based mechanism for sending 
SOAP requests. A WSDL (Web Service Definition Language) to C compiler 
which generates stubs for easily calling remote SOAP methods, and a 
CORBA IDL to WSDL compiler are also included.

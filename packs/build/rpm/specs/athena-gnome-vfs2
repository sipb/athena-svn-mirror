GNOME VFS is the GNOME virtual file system. It is the foundation of
the Nautilus file manager.  It provides a modular architecture and
ships with several modules that implement support for file systems,
http, ftp and others.  It provides a URI-based API, a backend
supporting asynchronous file operations, a MIME type manipulation
library and other features.

%description
The librep shared library implements a Lisp dialect that is
lightweight, reasonably fast, and extensible.  It contains an
interpreter, byte-code compiler, and virtual machine.  Applications
may use the interpreter as an extension language, or it may be used
for standalone scripts.  The Lisp dialect was originally inspired by
Emacs Lisp.  Unlike Emacs Lisp, the reliance on dynamic scope has been
removed and librep only has a single namespace for symbols.

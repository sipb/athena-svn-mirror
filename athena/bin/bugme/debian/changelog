debathena-bugme (10.0.1-0debathena1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add a handler for timer window visibility events, to raise the
    window when it has been obscured (e.g. by Nautilus when it takes
    over the desktop). (Trac: #324)
  * Change the timer window from a popup to a normal toplevel window,
    but disallowing input focus, so that it does not obscure menu
    items.

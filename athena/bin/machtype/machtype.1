.TH MACHTYPE 1 "May 14 1996"
.SH NAME
machtype \- Print machine type to standard output
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B machtype
[-c] [-d] [-r] [-M] [-v] [-A] [-L] [-P] [-N] [-E] [-S] [-k kernel] [-m memory] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Machtype
prints the CPU type to standard output.  It prints "sun4" when run on a
Sun and "sgi" when run on an SGI.
.TP
.B -c
Print the specific cpu type (e.g. SPARC/5 or IP22).
.TP
.B -d
Print the types of display attached to the system (e.g.  "cgthree").
.TP
.B -r
Print the types of any disk drives attached to the syystem, one to a
line, as in "SUN0535".
.TP
.B -M
Print the physical memory present (in hex).
.TP
.B -k
Override the default kernel:
.I /vmunix.
.TP
.B -m
Override the default memory:
.I /dev/kmem
used to look up the specific cpu type, displays, and disk drives.
.TP
.B -v
Verbose output (suitable for humans to read, instead of computers).
.TP
.B -A
Print out the release that machtype was compiled under.
.TP
.B -P
Print out the version of the Athena system packs attached, from 
.I /srvd/.rvdinfo
.TP
.B -L
Print out the version of Athena installed on the local system from
.I /etc/athena/version.
.TP
.B -N
Print out the name of the base operating system machtype was compiled
under; if used with the "-v" flag, the version number of the OS will
be included as well.  Current values for the name of the base OS are
"SunOS" and "IRIX".
.TP
.B -E
Print out the version number of the base operating system machtype was
compiled under.
.TP
.B -S
Print out the "Athena System" name for the current architecture. This
value is normally stored in the environment variable ATHENA_SYS, and
ideally corresponds to the AFS system name for the same machine
assuming the machine were running AFS. This value is used in the Athena
environment as part of a scheme for laying out filesystems containing
binaries for multiple architectures. See \fIlockers\fR(7) for more
information.
.PP
.I Machtype
is useful for conditionalizing shell scripts, .login files, etc. in an
environment that contains filesystems shared across several different
architectures.
.SH SEE ALSO
csh(1), lockers(7)
.SH BUGS
Prints "UNKNOWN video" when given the -d option on an SGI, since we
don't currently know how to find the display hardware on an SGI.

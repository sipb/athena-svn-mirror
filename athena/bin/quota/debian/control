Description: Print disk usage and quota limits
 Quota displays a user's disk usage and limits on local and NFS mounted 
 file systems, as well as AFS lockers that have been attached. If a user 
 is specified (by name or by id), quota will return information on disk 
 usage and limits for that user. Normal users can only check their own 
 quotas. The super-user may check any quota on local filesystems.
 .
 This package installs quota as /usr/bin/quota.debathena.  If you want
 /usr/bin/quota to point there, install the debathena-quota-config
 package.

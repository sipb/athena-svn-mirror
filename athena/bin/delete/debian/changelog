debathena-delete (10.0.2-0debathena1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patches from Jonathan Kamens:
    - The "-f" flag to delete should suppress nonexistent file errors but
      not other errors.
    - When the "-v" flag is specified to expunge, the correct totals
      should be reported.  Previously, the totals were incorrect.
    - Code cleanup.

debathena-delete (10.0.1-0debathena1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patches from Jonathan Kamens:
    - When recursively deleting a directory, read in the directory's
      entire contents before deleting anything so readdir doesn't get
      confused
    - Change the ENOMATCH error constant to DELETE_ENOMATCH to avoid
      conflicting with a system error constant of the same name
    - When printing an amount of space, print it in friendly units, e.g.,
      KB, MB or GB, rather than always printing kb.
    - Fix a double free in lsdel
    - Fix compiler nit by including <string.h> in stack.c
    - Fix compiler nit by adding missing prototyle to directories.h
    - Change the "st_chtime" structure member to "st_ctim" to avoid a
      potential header file conflict.
    - Don't try to use symbolic links on platforms that don't have them.
    - When adding to an array, leave some extra space at the end so that
      we don't have to keep growing it every time.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Lsdel
lists files that have been marked for deletion by the \fIdelete\fR(1)
program.
.PP
For information about using wildcards with \fIlsdel\fR, see
\fIundelete\fR(1).
.PP
Filenames passed to \fIlsdel\fR can be directories (non-deleted or
deleted) or deleted files.  If a non-deleted directory is specified,
lsdel lists the deleted contents of that directory.  If the
.BR \-r
option is specified, all non-deleted children of the directory will be
searched recursively for deleted files.  If no command-line filenames
are specified,
.I lsdel
defaults to the current working directory.
.PP
.I Lsdel
recursively lists deleted directories by default.  This can be
disabled with the
.BR \-d
option, which causes directory names, rather than their contents, to
be listed.
.PP
The
.BR \-t
option allows the user to specify a minimum age, in days, of files to
list.  Only files that were
.IR delete d
\fIn\fR days or more ago will be listed.
.PP
The
.BR \-s
options tells
.I lsdel
to follow symbolic links when searching for deleted files.  The
.BR \-m
option does the same thing for mount points.
.PP
The
.BR \-y
option causes
.I lsdel
to print the total amount of space taken up by all the files it lists.
.PP
The
.BR \-1
option forces output to be one file per line; this is the default when
output is not to a terminal.  The
.BR \-C
option does the opposite, forcing multi-column output, which is the
default when output is to a terminal.
